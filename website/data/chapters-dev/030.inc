<span class="caplead">Client 4.7.3 played</span> before an adoring throng of pink-haired girls and slim-hipped guys. His electric guitar screamed in ecstasy beneath his motion-blurred fingers. The song finished, and he spread his arms to embrace the spotlight.
</p>
<p>
And felt sick to his stomach.
</p>
<p>
His life was a hedonistic montage of rock god glory &mdash; and he hated every second of it. Sex was cheap and joyless. Drugs numbed him but brought him no pleasure. Mansions were only good for parties, and he could no longer stand the people he partied with.
</p>
<p>
He cancelled his tour, revved up his rusty old Ford F-150, and drove all the way back to his home town. Down the street from his high school, he found a coffee shop at a glitzy new shopping center. He booked a gig there under his original name, and played a few sombre tunes that he had never gotten a chance to release because they didn’t fit his “image”. There were only six people in that audience, but he looked into each of their eyes as he sang. And when his set was over, he went out back for a cigarette, and sobbed with joy.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
“We’re still detecting photostimulation-induced emetic potentition.”
</p>
<p>
“I thought the nausea was part of the narrative this time.”
</p>
<p>
“Creative Control worked the defect into the storyboard with some very quick thinking. But it’s a bug, not a feature.”
</p>
<p>
“Alright. I’ll patch it in the next release build.”
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
Client 4.8.1 had vowed for years that someday she would just drop everything &mdash; her six-figure legal career, her Chelsea loft, her wine-guzzling girlfriends &mdash; and go open a small cupcake shop in Maine. It was just a joke, a mere idle fantasy, until the day she finally mustered her courage and did it. At first she was terrified that she would hate it. But watching people buy her colorful puffballs &mdash; seeing their eyes light up when they took a bite and hearing that little squeal they made through a mouth full of soft deliciousness &mdash; gave her a genuine thrill every time. It was hard work, and business was frequently uneasy and uncertain. Yet here she was, turning on her bakery lights at 5am on a frigid orange-leafed autumn morning, ready to bake a breakfast selection of Halloween-themed pastries. And she couldn’t be happier.
</p>
<p>
If only the lights in her eyes didn’t make her queasy for some reason…
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
“I thought you said you fixed that.”
</p>
<p>
“I thought I did! Here, come take a look…”
</p>
<p>
Daniel sat before a translucent screen wide enough to wrap in a half-circle around his desk. His head was silhouetted in its light &mdash; the smooth dome of his cranium, the loose strands around his temples, the fluffy silver fur around his chin.
</p>
<p>
The screen itself glowed with a maze of windows. Some held software develpment environments, with colorful cascades of indented text. Some showed rotating three-dimensional wire-mesh diagrams of organic structures. Some displayed rendered animations of mundane scenes &mdash; a small-town coffee shop, a bakery in Maine.
</p>
<p>
But the window he focused on now was a long, jagged graph of parallel sensor readouts. 
</p>
<p>
“What do you think, T? I’m not doing that, am I?”
</p>
<p>
“You are.” Tina leaned her face beside his, studying the chart. She draped an arm over Daniel’s shoulder, and he reciprocated with a hand on the small of her back. The march of time had chiseled her contours into a firm visage of competence and confidence, smart and strong and feminine. She radiated a kind of mature beauty only expressed in those who have rightfully earned it. “The <em>area postrema</em> is extremely dopamine-sensitive. You’re trying too hard. Turn down the external stimulation. Let the cognitive systems do the work. Let them come to their conclusions on their own.”
</p>
<p>
He smiled. “Ah. Of course. That <em>is</em> the entire point.”
</p>

<div class="chapsection">
<p>
<span class="caplead">Alyssa Crawford felt the cushion</span> beneath her back, the headset straps behind her ears. Her hands clutched at the armrests of her recliner, and she started to pull herself up.
</p>
<p>
“No no! Not yet! Let your mind come back into your body.” The woman’s soft voice was simultaneously soothing and authoritative, like a wise matriarch. “We’re going to take off your goggles now, alright? On the count of ten, nine, eight…”
</p>
<p>
The pale glowing nothingness lifted away, and her eyes regained focus. Before her, she saw the warm, kind face of her clinician, Dr. Natalie Rosenbaum-Braun.
</p>
<p>
“Your name is Alyssa Crawford,” Dr. Rosenbaum-Braun said in that calming yet powerful voice. “You’re a thirty-one-year-old divorce attorney in New York City. Right now you’re in Seattle, in the Life Choices Projection Clinic…”
</p>
<p>
As the doctor spoke, Alyssa slowly grew aware of medical equipment surrounding her &mdash; glowing displays of jumpy lines, transparent plastic bags of fluid hanging from metal clips. Nurses and technicians scurried around her, making announcements such as, “Prefrontal suppressors fully drained,” or, “Melatonin and GABA levels both back to baseline.”
</p>
<p>
“You were in an induced REM-like state for just under two hours,” said the doctor as she removed tubes from the back of her hand.
</p>
<p>
Alyssa gasped. “It… It felt like <em>years</em>…”
</p>
<p>
“Talk to me about your experience.”
</p>
<p>
Alyssa struggled for words as reality returned to her. “I… I <em>knew</em> it was a simulation the whole time. But it didn’t matter, you know? You ever have dreams like that? Where you know it’s a dream, but that doesn’t change how real it all seems at the time? I came up with such a great recipe for a spice-infused devil’s food brownie… I… I’m trying to remember it now, but…”
</p>
<p>
Dr. Rosenbaum-Braun doctor smiled kindly. “Let’s not fixate on that. You didn’t <em>really</em> live through several years in the last few hours, after all. We just alter the way your brain records memories, to make you <em>remember</em> it as though you did. You can’t actually learn new skills or produce creative works while you’re under. We have clients, for example, that imagine writing a movie, but they don’t wake up with a full screenplay in their heads. Or they become a piano virtuoso, but you can’t squeeze ten thousand hours of practice into a two-hour augmented hypnotherapy session. But the <em>effects</em> of having those skills and producing those works &mdash; the impact on you as a person, how they would affect your perception of yourself and the way you interact with the world &mdash; <em>that</em> part can teach us something. Let’s expore that. How is Maine Cupcake Alyssa different from who you are now?”
</p>
<p>
Alyssa caught herself laughing. “Doctor… Real-Life Me works with people that are literally going through the worst time of their lives. They’re hurt and bitter and vindictive. People hire me to stick it to their soon-to-be exes, or justify their cheating. It… It gets so ugly. But <em>in there</em>, I made people <em>happy</em>. I could <em>see</em> them smile before my eyes. And… I had no idea that something like that was missing from my life until now. Sure, I mean, it’s just a cupcake. It’s just a fleeting moment of pleasure. But it’s <em>real</em> pleasure. I don’t know; maybe I’m doing more overall good in the world where I am now. But… maybe <em>I</em> don’t have to be the one doing it. It’s not like Manhattan has a shortage of divorce lawyers.”
</p>
<p>
Dr. Rosenbaum-Braun coaxed her to lift her head, and removed a flexible cap of electrodes from her skull, carefully separating it from her hair. “Let’s not be too hasty. You shouldn’t start making major decisions after <em>one</em> treatment. Eventually you might decide to practice a different kind of law. Or you might take on some volunteer work. Or you might change nothing &mdash; at least, not on the surface &mdash; but simply learn to see your current situation in a different light.” The doctor held her hand and helped her stand up. “You’re certainly not alone. Many of our clients don’t know what they want until they see it played out before them. Some <em>think</em> they know what they want, only to find that actually <em>having</em> it brings them no joy. And others realize that the thing they thought they needed was something they already had all along. That’s why we’re here.”
</p>
<p>
“Doctor, I do have a question,” Alyssa said, still unsteady on her feet. “Around the end there, while I was waking up… Why did all of my cupcakes grow arms and legs and start kung-fu fighting?”
</p>

<p>
<span class="caplead">“God damn it, Moshen!”</span> Daniel crashed through the double doors of the Realtime Creative Control Room.  
</p>
<p>
Moshen, giggling hysterically, sat at a desk similar to Daniel’s. His wraparound screen, however, was covered in tree-like diagrams and artistic sketches &mdash; a sort of nonlinear comic strip, where each square had three or four different panels that could potentially follow it. Unlike Daniel’s pristine console, Moshen’s workstation was littered with soda and Cheetos; and while Daniel’s monitor was translucent, the screen before Moshen’s face sported an animated background of knights and dragons. Moshen himself was neither small nor scrawny anymore, but he still laughed with the sly mirth of a prank-pulling adolescent boy.
</p>
<p>
“Do you think that was <em>funny</em>?” Daniel demanded.
</p>
<p>
Beside Moshen’s desk were two others. Mike sat at one, his thick scruff now graying. His screen was strewn with annnotated pictures of people’s faces &mdash; some photographed, some rendered, and some simply cartoons. At the other sat Rosie, grown well into adulthood, holding a stylus in her hand and wearing polarized glasses to view her console &mdash; which was filled with 3D wireframe models of houses, furniture, trees, and shops. Above their desks, respectively, stood placards reading “PLOT”, “CHARACTER”, and “SETTING”. 
</p>
<p>
All three of them were silently laughing. Their shoulders shook, their eyes twinkled at him.
</p>
<p>
Daniel’s stern face collapsed into a chuckle. “Alright, yes. That <em>was</em> pretty cute, guys.”
</p>
<p>
From across the room, past the desks of two dozen other supporting employees, Daniel heard a loud, “Ahem!” Jason sat at a small conference table behind a glass partition near the reception area. Seated across from him was a tall, thin, bespectacled man in a well-worn suit. Jason was smiling; the man was not. With a voice growing dry with age, Jason said, “And here, Mr. Caldwell, is the CTO and co-founder of this organization.” As Daniel trod over and exchanged handshakes and pleasure-to-meet-yous with the visitor, Jason said, “Mr. Caldwell is a compliance officer at Morgan Stanley.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah, you must be here about our IPO!” Daniel replied.
</p>
<p>
“I am,” Caldwell said humorlessly as Daniel sat down across from him. “I need to make sure that all of your assets are properly accounted for before we can move forward with the underwriting. I’m hoping you can resolve a few anomalies about the origins of this facility.”
</p>
<p>
Daniel took a deep breath, leaned back slowly, and splayed his fingers toward the newcomer. “We have nothing to hide, Mr. Caldwell. T and I built this place from scratch. &mdash; Er, that’s Christina, I mean. My partner. In every sense.” He proudly rubbed his wedding ring. “She should be in this meeting, actually. She’s doing post-session diagnostics right now, but I can call her once she’s done.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps,” replied Caldwell, jotting notes. “Does she know about the illegal source of your seed capital?”
</p>
<p>
Daniel cocked his head. “I beg your pardon?”
</p>
<p>
“The Zheleznov fortune,” said Caldwell, punctuating the statement by pushing his glasses higher on his nose. “Let’s speak frankly here. Both Sergey Mukhayev’s and Ivan Zheleznov’s accounts were compromised during the events of the Medina Gallante. Both men died that day. You were identified and investigated, but ultimately no prosecutor could find enough evidence to implicate you. Hard drives were found scrubbed, log files were missing, phone records were obfuscated. Several years later, you returned from relative obscurity, with millions of dollars to pour into this project here. The obvious conclusions are a bit… unsavory.”
</p>
<p>
Daniel looked directly into Caldwell’s eyes. “That <em>is</em> the impression that you might be left with, if all your information comes from my interviews with <em>Time</em> and <em>Wired</em> and Gawker. And I imagine those media outlets edited for that effect intentionally &mdash; controversy generates click revenue, after all. But let me clarify a few things. First, the police seized most of Sergey’s money. The little that was left, we were going to use for Leo’s legal defense fund. But he insisted we use it for private school and college for Rosie. That’s why Leo ended up taking the fall for all Mukhayev family operations, and why he’s still in prison. Rosie still visits him regularly.”
</p>
<p>
Caldwell scoffed. “That accounts for the molehill, but not the mountain. What about all the money from the Zheleznov consortium?”
</p>
<p>
Daniel exchanged a wry look with Jason. “We never actually hacked that account.”
</p>
<p>
Caldwell peered over the top of his glasses.
</p>
<p>
“We were able to deduce its balance, yes,” said Daniel. “But we never managed to crack into it. Ivan used an OTP keyfob, and all transfers required two-factor authentication. Even if we had gotten his password, we never would have been able to move money out of it. Our promise to split the fortune among his men… It was a bluff. A piece of information that itself was fake, but designed to have a real effect. In other words, a hack.”
</p>
<p>
Caldwell looked around the room. “So where <em>did</em> the seed capital for all this come from?”
</p>
<p>
Daniel smiled wistfully. “From me, actually. But I was only able to do it thanks to this guy.” He jerked his thumb at Jason, who blushed. “When the assets of Tungsten, my old company, finally went up for auction, he used his private funds to make winning bids on everything that I had personally developed during my years there. My patents, my code, my designs &mdash; all the intellectual property that I had produced while salaried for them, he bought up. And then… he gave it all to me. Gifted it. He called it a bonus.”
</p>
<p>
Jason added, “You were right from the very start, Dan. It was all rightfully yours.”
</p>
<p>
“I licensed my technologies to cellular providers,” Daniel continued. “And <em>that</em> is where I got the revenue to build this place.”
</p>
<p>
Caldwell made a few noncommittal grunts as he scribbled on his notepad. Daniel couldn’t tell if the banker was relieved or disappointed. “Technology licensing,” he said without looking up. “I understand that’s your post-IPO revenue strategy, yes?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s right,” said Daniel. “We want to release these capabilities for third-party development. Other people will find ways to build upon what we’ve created here in ways that we haven’t yet imagined. Maybe they can use this technology to run virtual vacation companies where they sell the secret agent missions on Mars; or perhaps enter the dreams of billionaire heirs to convince them to dissolve their fathers’ conglomerates. But for me and T and the rest of us here, we figured we would use it for something a bit more therapeutic.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I have the same question about your technologies as I do about your finances,” Caldwell replied. “No other party can lay claim to your intellectual property? Contest your patents? Demand royalties?”
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Caldwell, I don’t know if I would even be <em>able</em> to enjoy any of this if it had come from stolen origins. What my friends and I have created here, we’ve created ourselves.”
</p>
<p>
Caldwell checked his tablet screen. “So you would be able to speak about the process by which all of this was developed, I presume?”
</p>
<p>
Daniel laughed warmly. “Most people can’t get me to <em>stop</em> speaking about it! You see, our technology is all based on one simple premise: that it’s possible to work with the brain as neurochemical machinery. Thinking, feeling, wanting, dreaming &mdash; they’re all <em>physical</em> processes. When you understand how the components work, it becomes possible to analyze thoughts flowing through a human mind the same way you analyze instructions flowing through a computer’s CPU. When a neurobiologist talks about what motivates a person, how a person perceives the world and acts on their desires… When you talk about that stuff armed with actual knowledge of how the brain operates, you’re not talking philosophy. You’re talking <em>engineering</em>. We each have the power to <em>reprogram ourselves</em>. This facility is simply a way to help people to that. A dev kit, if you will. The question is: What kind of apps will you write on the platform that is your brain? The answer to that, is entirely up to you.”

<span class="caplead">Clients 7.1.1, 7.1.2, and 7.1.3</span> filled out the forms, strapped the caps and goggles over their heads, let the nurses attach tubes to their bodies, and settled into their recliners. They didn’t know exactly what awaited them, but they could hardly wait to experience it. Reading reviews and listening to friends, they had heard that the process enabled them to discover what it would be like to live out their heart’s desires. And, in the process, possibly even discover what those desires might be.
