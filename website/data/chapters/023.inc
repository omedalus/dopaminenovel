<p>
<span class="caplead">Pike Place Market on a sunny afternoon</span> bustled with the teeming, cacophonous crowd. Tourists, locals, and seagulls alike swarmed through the elaborate multi-level pavilion, where the smell of fresh fish and the music of street performers filled the air. Built on a steep slope overlooking Elliott Bay and the Alaskan Way Viaduct, the countless shops and cafés of the Market were constructed literally one on top of another, connected by chaotic networks of stairs and ramps melding indoors and out. Local farmers set up their wares in tents, their carts filled with fresh fruits and honey on the comb. Craftsmen hocked watercolor paintings and wooden sculptures of bears and herons. Charismatic fishmongers theatrically threw entire salmon back and forth to one another over the heads of customers, to raucous cheers and the flashes of cameras. 
</p>
<p>
The Market was a logical meeting place. The presence of all these people served as implicit assurance that there would be no funny business. There was safety in the crowd.
</p>
<p>
Sergey Mukhayev sat in a wicker patio chair at a small round table at an outdoor café, sipping tea and waiting. 
</p>
<p>
The tea was hot, black, and strong. He knew he wasn’t supposed to indulge, just like he wasn’t supposed to drink vodka anymore, nor enjoy many others of his old favorite vices. If he was the same man now as he was back in Saint Petersburg, he’d tell his doctors to go rot in Hell. But he had Rosie to consider now. It was his own fault that she was without a mother and brother. He didn’t dare risk making her grow up without a father as well.
</p>
<p>
This one cup of tea that he enjoyed now wouldn’t kill him. It was simply a nod to the truth &mdash; and the truth, like the tea, was bitter. It would be ten years before Rosie would graduate college. His chances of seeing that happen were fifty-fifty at best. In however many years remained for him, his sole purpose was to secure her future, to at least partially rectify the tragedy he had made of her innocent young life. His business, with its secrecy and its violence and its constant interaction with the scum of humanity, unfortunately happened to be very, very lucrative. Through it he had caused his own damnation. And through it, he sought to earn some small glimmer of redemption.
</p>
<p>
The Byzantine cross he wore around his neck lay on his hairy, muscular chest, a few inches from the scars. It served as a perpetual reminder that he may as well occasionally enjoy life’s small blessings, such as the tea, while he still could &mdash; for his next world would be far less pleasant than this one.
</p>
<p>
He felt the caffeinated drink begin to take its effect. His heart quickened. Ironic stuff, tea was &mdash; so soothing to the mind, yet so stressing to the body.
</p>
<p>
And with the quickening came the pain.
</p>
<p>
A sharp pinching sensation stabbed inward to the center of his chest, like heartburn after a meal of needles. He pressed his hand to his sternum and winced. His head felt light and woozy, as though he had stood up too quickly. His hearing began to fade.
</p>
<p>
He coughed hard several times. The coughing was not caused by the attacks; rather, it was a conscious reaction. There was something about the dry hacking motion that helped get the blood flowing back to his head.
</p>
<p>
His large fingers felt around in his pocket for his pills, searching for the small smooth beads of chewable aspirin mixed in among the hard round beta-blockers and the long oval statin tablets. He preferred to keep them jumbled in his pocket, outside their bottles. Bottles of pills made distinct rattling noises when he moved, and he’d be damned if he was going to walk around the city jingling with medication like a goddamned feeble geriatric. He was only forty-seven years old and still strong as an ox &mdash; his muscles lacked the definition they’d once had in his youth, but his arms were still the size of hams and he could crush a man’s skull with his bare hands. He was still as mighty and powerful as ever. And if any lousy cretin dared to look at him like some kind of poor frail invalid, he’d sooner stab the son of a bitch’s eyes out than suffer a moment of his pity. 
</p>
<p>
The aspirin worked quickly. Soon after popping the small white pills, the pain subsided. Sergey resumed sipping his tea calmly, as though nothing was wrong.
</p>
<p>
From behind him came a man’s voice. It was dry and aged. “Sergey Mukhayev,” it said flatly. Its pronunciation of his name was clear and crisp. Rather than the lisping Anglicized bastardization to which he had grown accustomed over the last decade, the voice intoned his name with the true, rich, heavy consonants of a native Russian speaker.
</p>
<p>
He turned and looked up. A gaunt, gray, elderly face looked back at him through cold, inscrutable blue eyes. 
</p>
<p>
The old man carried a manila envelope. He sat down across the table, took a sip from a bottle of seltzer water, and spoke in Russian.
</p>
<p>
“You’re a difficult man to contact, Sergey,” he said. “Are you hiding, or just taking a little break?”
</p>
<p>
Sergey stared at the man suspiciously. “I’ve had a few issues with my communication channels lately,” he grumbled.
</p>
<p>
“Indeed,” said the man. “You know, you certainly don’t make my life easy. Unfortunately, part of my assignment here in this city is to keep an eye on you. Let me assure you, it’s a duty I very much don’t relish &mdash; it distracts me from far more interesting pursuits. And you’ve made it especially difficult for me this morning. You don’t reply to your email, your telephone goes straight to voicemail, you ignore your Skype… Why, if that Leo boy hadn’t answered for you, I was about ready to send a courier over to your house.”
</p>
<p>
“Am I supposed to know you?” Sergey replied.
</p>
<p>
“No,” said the old man. “But it’s part of my job to know you.”
</p>
<p>
“The pleasure’s all yours, then,” said Sergey.
</p>
<p>
“I am called Pyotr Passinsky,” he replied. “<em>Doctor</em> Pyotr Passinsky.” He spoke impeccable Russian with a highbrow Muscovite dialect, articulating every complex syllable and putting exactly the right lilt into each vowel. The accent fell upon the Russian ear similarly to the sound of High British to a native English speaker. The affectation connoted either great intelligence and fine breeding, or extreme arrogance and unadulterated pomposity.
</p>
<p>
The old man extended a handshake. Sergey did not accept. “Am I supposed to be impressed?” he scoffed. 
</p>
<p>
The gaunt gray figure replied coldly, “You should respect your elders.”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe I’d respect you,” said Sergey, “if I knew who the hell you are and what you want with me.”
</p>
<p>
“Who I am is a victim of your aggression, and what I want is restitution,” Passinsky said without emotion. “Your men broke into my company last night, Sergey. Tungsten Medical Technologies. Well, it’s not <em>my</em> company, of course, but I’m responsible for keeping it running. Your barbaric little adventure makes me look very bad, especially considering that part of my duties is to make sure you aren’t misbehaving. And your timing could not be worse. My boss, as it so happens, is flying into town as we speak, to discuss corporate financial matters. I’m now, in addition to our scheduled affairs, forced to explain the extremely unpleasant situation resulting from your highly uncouth actions.”
</p>
<p>
Sergey snorted. “<em>My</em> men? <em>My</em> actions? That’s quite some accusations you’re leveling there, <em>Doctor</em>. It’s a shame I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
</p>
<p>
Passinsky crinkled his tall forehead. “Oh really?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s right,” Sergey said with a vaguely threatening air.
</p>
<p>
“The evidence says otherwise,” said Passinsky.
</p>
<p>
Sergey rolled his eyes and chuckled contemptuously. “<em>Evidence</em>? You have no evidence on me, you old ass.” His own voice came off as slow, shrewd, and somewhat snide, with exaggerated “o” sounds and hardened consonants. He had spent most of his life in Saint Petersburg, on the cold, humid shores of the Baltic Sea. It was a worldly metropolis &mdash; a city of art and theatre, of literature and music, and of crime and corruption so brazen that it would have made Prohibition-era Chicago look like the Smurfs’ Village. Sergey’s subtle accent conveyed cleverness, rugged resilience, and an attitude toward authority that could not be properly described in polite company.
</p>
<p>
The old man’s face showed profound irritation. He reached into the manila envelope he carried, and withdrew a sheet of paper to lay on the table. Upon the paper was a printed screenshot of a security camera recording, with text indicating the timestamp. It showed Eugene, clad in his now-destroyed Italian leather jacket, standing in a brightly lit room filled with glassware, refrigerators, and scientific equipment. He was holding a young woman at gunpoint with one of those tiny snubnose .44 Magnum hand-cannons of which he was so fond.
</p>
<p>
“Are you going to deny that this is your nephew Eugene?” asked Passinsky.
</p>
<p>
“What if I do?” Sergey shot back.
</p>
<p>
Passinsky’s cold eyes narrowed. “Kindly spare me the trouble of proving what we both already know. I’m a scientist, not a judicial magistrate. I refuse to waste my time playing pointless mind-games with you.”
</p>
<p>
Sergey smirked. “Then you shouldn’t have sat down here.” He haughtily slid the paper back across the table toward the elderly man. “I have no idea who that is,” Sergey said conclusively.
</p>
<p>
Passinsky exhaled sharply through his nose. “Fine,” said his dry old voice. “In that case, let’s see if <em>this</em> one rings a bell…”
</p>
<p>
From his manila envelope he produced another paper. It bore the printed image of a thin, intelligent-looking man. Sergey recognized him from the factory: it was the technical savant who seemed to be plaguing Sergey at every turn. On the page, the scoundrel stood before Eugene in an office hallway, wearing a lab coat, wielding his devil-spawned contraption.
</p>
<p>
Sergey’s fists clenched at the sight of him.
</p>
<p>
Passinsky gave an affirmative nod. “So, I take it you know him?”
</p>
<p>
Sergey growled, “He and I have… encountered one another, yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Just as I thought, then,” said Passinsky. “It appears this fellow has been a thorn in both of our sides.”
</p>
<p>
Sergey nodded slowly, his eyes locked on the paper.
</p>
<p>
“It may interest you to know,” said Passinsky, “that, from what I can tell, this is not his usual line of work. Apparently he’s just a computer engineer &mdash; originally specialized in circuit design and microchip fabrication, then eventually transitioned to software. As far as engineers go, he appears to be a highly skilled one, but he’s otherwise rather unremarkable. Aside from having worked on a few civilian contracts for the United States Navy, he doesn’t even appear to have any military affiliation.”
</p>
<p>
“How is he called?” Sergey hissed.
</p>
<p>
Passinsky held up his manila envelope. “It is all here,” he said. “His name, his address, his social groups, his favorite activities, everything.” He waved the envelope near his head, but made no move to pass it across the table.
</p>
<p>
Sergey stared at him for a few moments, keeping a poker face. “Supposing I was interested…”
</p>
<p>
Passinsky rolled his eyes. “Sergey, you are interested. I will not play silly games with you, you punk! Do you understand?”
</p>
<p>
“What do you want for it?” Sergey asked flatly.
</p>
<p>
“You know perfectly well what I want, Sergey,” said the old man. “In our conversation on Leo’s telephone, you implied that it is in your possession.”
</p>
<p>
“Suppose I lied,” Sergey said standoffishly. “Or suppose I didn’t bring it. Suppose I came here only to find out who you are and what you have to offer. And now that I know, suppose I simply reach over this table, grab that envelope from your weak old hands, and walk away?” 
</p>
<p>
Passinsky grimaced in disgust at him. “Ugh! Even an overgrown Leningrad street urchin such as you should at least feel some shame&mdash;”
</p>
<p>
“It’s called Saint Petersburg, you vegetable-brained geriatric,” Sergey interrupted. “It hasn’t been called Leningrad in over twenty years.”
</p>
<p>
“Whatever. Consider it in practical terms, then,” Passinsky chided. “Why do you think I agreed to meet you here, in this venue? You think it was for <em>your</em> benefit? Think twice before attacking an old man in public, Sergey. You’d certainly never get away with it.” He leaned back and, with arms spread wide, gestured to the throngs of people milling about the shops and stands of Pike Place Market.
</p>
<p>
“Fine. But then, even someone as obviously senile as you should at least feel some shame in making me such a pathetic offer,” Sergey replied snidely. “A tube filled with nearly priceless microbes, in exchange for some papers about some random man whom I only care about as an afterthought?”
</p>
<p>
“Need I remind you,” Passinsky pressed, “that the vial is, in fact, useless to you? You do not know how to use its contents. As such, you have nothing to gain through your refusal to cooperate.” 
</p>
<p>
“Oh sure, that’s true,” Sergey said breezily. “But I also know <em>you</em> want it very badly, and I’m quite certain you’d be willing to give me much, much more for it than…” He waved at the envelope.  “…<em>that</em>. No, good Doctor. I think I’ll keep what’s mine.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s <em>not</em> yours,” said Passinsky.
</p>
<p>
“It is now,” Sergey smirked. 
</p>
<p>
The elderly man hesitated for a moment, then sighed and leaned forward, clasping his hands. “Sergey, let me make something perfectly clear,” he said . “This exchange that I propose is strictly a professional courtesy. I sincerely hope that you brought the vial here with you, and that you are willing to hand it over amicably. Because if you do not, then I’ll have to have my boss’s men raid your house and extract it from you by force &mdash; and if you are indeed having such ‘communication problems’ as you seem to describe, then you are hardly in a position to put up much of a fight. Now, my friend, I would really prefer that the matter does not escalate to such a level &mdash; not because I give a damn about you, but because it would greatly displease my boss, and make me look even more foolish before him than I already do. And my boss is not a man I wish to displease further. So that is why I extend to you the invitation of handling this matter by way of exchange &mdash; it is the closest I can come to a win-win solution. Do you understand?” 
</p>
<p>
Sergey stared at the old scientist contemptuously.
</p>
<p>
Passinsky stared back. “Need I remind you, I’ve already demonstrated that I know how to reach you, where you live, and who your family is.”
</p>
<p>
Sergey looked away with a snarl. Reluctantly, bitterly, he reached into his pocket, withdrew the small smiley-faced vial of crusty pale brown goo, and laid it on the table. 
</p>
<p>
Passinsky gave him the manila envelope, and took the vial up in his liver-spotted fingers. “I’m glad we could come to an agreement.”
</p>
<p>
Sergey didn’t respond. He merely opened the envelope and examined the papers inside. For a few moments, he read the documents in silence. “So… Are we done here?” Sergey said, without looking up.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said the old scientist, “there is perhaps another matter, more personal in nature.”
</p>
<p>
Sergey folded up the papers and put them in his pocket. “What is it now?” he grumbled.
</p>
<p>
“This person whom those papers describe, this ‘Daniel’ fellow… He’s built a most remarkable machine. A rifle that shoots a pulse of electromagnetic energy…”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, yes.” Sergey groaned. “It kills electronics, I know.”
</p>
<p>
“From a technical perspective, I’m quite curious about this machine. If there’s any chance you could procure it for me, I could reward you. It really is a very interesting invention.”
</p>
<p>
Sergey snorted. “That the accursed piece of garbage is the bane of my existence. I’d sooner shove it into a trash compactor.”
</p>
<p>
 “You know, a young man at my office helped me identify it. You’ll never believe where he recognized the device from. An old computer game! Entertainment for children! Delightful, isn’t it? And do you know what its function was in this computer game? Deactivating robots and… Another kind of monster… My young colleague used an amusing word for it: ‘cyborg’. Do you know what a cyborg is, Sergey?”
</p>
<p>
Sergey stared at the old scientist with a bored expression.
</p>
<p>
“Oh Sergey, you of all people really should learn this word. A ‘cyborg’, you see, is a creature that is part man, part machine. A man who’s had parts of his body replaced or augmented with electronic components. Parts of his body that no longer function properly because of injury or illness. Do you understand my meaning, my friend?”
</p>
<p>
Slowly, Sergey’s bored demeanor faded to a combination of humiliation and indignant rage as he grasped the old scientist’s insinuations. Defiantly and protectively, he folded one arm across his chest, and leaned menacingly toward the old man. “The state of my body is absolutely none of your concern, you parasite-infested swine!” he hissed.
</p>
<p>
“It is nothing to be ashamed about,” Passinsky said flatly. “In fact, in your position I would consider it a source of pride! A testimony to the fact that we truly do live in future times. A living embodiment of the power of technology over the weaknesses of the flesh.”
</p>
<p>
“How dare you!” Sergey spat. “Whose flesh are you calling ‘weak’, you decrepit old cur? I could break you in half with a flick of my wrist!”
</p>
<p>
Passinsky shook his bald, silver-fringed head. “Such hostility, over something so inspirational.”
</p>
<p>
“How the hell do you know these things about me?” he snarled at the old man. “Why have you been watching me!? Who the hell do you think you are?”
</p>
<p>
Passinsky shrugged innocently. “You were simply a part of my assignment, Sergey. It’s nothing personal &mdash; not for <em>me</em>, anyway. My boss knew you’d moved your operation to Seattle after your little falling-out in Leningrad&mdash; sorry, Saint Petersburg. And, because of both the location of Tungsten’s offices and the nature of our research objectives, he thought it would make sense to keep track of you. Maybe even recruit you for some distribution work later if the timing proved right. Which, of course, is no longer a possibility under the circumstances…”
</p>
<p>
Sergey’s large fists clutched at the sides of the small table. “Why me? Why does your boss give a damn about me? How does he even know who I am?”
</p>
<p>
“My boss?” Passinsky said nonchalantly. “Well, I don’t know the details, but from what I understand, you two have a history. I hear you worked for him back in Saint Petersburg? Arranged some sales, apparently…”
</p>
<p>
Sergey felt his breath seize in his throat. His pulse throbbed on the sides of his neck. “No…” he gasped.
</p>
<p>
“I got the impression that something went sour between the two of you back then,” Passinsky continued passively. “He seemed extremely unhappy about something you’d done about ten years ago…”
</p>
<p>
The crowded pavilion spun around Sergey’s head, the shifting forms of shoppers and tourists suddenly making him feel nauseous and lightheaded. His breathing grew shaky. He coughed. He shook his head. He whinnied. It didn’t help.
</p>
<p>
“Something about… What was it?” Passinsky went on. “You kept too large a commission for yourself? Something along those lines? You lied about the size of a sale so you could keep the difference? He never really told me exactly what it was, and I never thought to ask…”
</p>
<p>
His hearing began to fade. In the periphery of his vision, Sergey could see intricate patterns of capillaries, surging with blood.
</p>
<p>
Passinsky added, “He’s called Ivan…”
</p>
<p>
Sergey shot up from his wicker chair. The edges of the small round table were already in the grasp of his large hands. Standing, he lifted the metal patio table a few inches and slammed it back down. The scientist’s bottle of seltzer water fell over and rolled off the edge. The delicate cup of tea, along with its saucer, tumbled and shattered against the patio deck. 
</p>
<p>
“He murdered my family!” Sergey screamed. 
</p>
<p>
Passersby gasped at the violent outburst and stared in shock. Patrons seated nearby backed away. Café staff turned their heads and watched nervously, glancing back and forth to one another to decide who, if anyone, should say something.
</p>
<p>
Passinsky flinched but remained seated. His face displayed, if anything, no more than simple annoyance.
</p>
<p>
“He killed Sveta! And Vadik!” Sergey spat. He leaned on the table, his hands still curled around its edges, his knuckles turning white. “His men broke into my home! They gassed me and electrocuted me with cattle prods! They tied me down and forced me to watch! Do you know what he did to them? Do you know!?”
</p>
<p>
Passinsky took a slow, calm sip of his tea, saying nothing. He set his cup carefully back down on the table. Finally, he replied, “I know what kind of man my boss is.”
</p>
<p>
Sergey suddenly looked away and hissed, “Your boss…! Ivan is your boss…!” He stood and gasped for air, his eyes wide with panic. “You run Tungsten and Ivan is your boss…”
</p>
<p>
Passinsky nodded affirmatively. “Yes. He’s the man that wires my paychecks. He created a fictitious investment consortium to move funds into the United States, but he’s the consortium’s sole member. Tungsten is his company.”
</p>
<p>
“Tungsten is his company…” Sergey repeated. 
</p>
<p>
Passinsky shrugged. “Of course. Surely you didn’t think that a company whose sole project is a new source of cocaine would have an entirely scrupulous investment provider.”
</p>
<p>
“Tungsten is Ivan’s company…,” Sergey stuttered. “It’s Ivan’s company… And I… I… Oh dear God…!” His hand shot up to the elaborate cross that hung from his neck, which he began rubbing frantically. “Oh dear Jesus… Oh sweet Mary, Mother of Christ… And he’s coming? Ivan’s coming? Here? Today?”
</p>
<p>
“He was already on his jet when I talked to him earlier this morning,” said Passinsky. “He might’ve landed by now. In any case, knowing how he operates, an advance group of his men is probably already in town.”
</p>
<p>
“But he doesn’t know, right?” Sergey said, his voice a combination of fury and pleading. “He doesn’t know that I… That my men… That we…”
</p>
<p>
Passinsky grunted. “Don’t be silly, Sergey. Of course he knows. I told him. And let me tell you, that was not a phone call that I enjoyed having to&mdash;”
</p>
<p>
The small table flew aside with a single swipe of Sergey’s hand. 
</p>
<p>
He grabbed the scientist by the collar, and hoisted the elderly man out of his wicker chair. “You son of a bitch!” Sergey screamed into his face, along with a litany of colorful invectives whose rich meanings would be lost in translation. He shook the frail gray form while the old man stammered and demanded that the brute unhand him.
</p>
<p>
The crowd erupted in protest. The commotion had put bystanders at alert, and many had already been preparing to intervene. Men rushed in &mdash; café staff, passersby, fellow patrons &mdash; to pull the large man off of the thin elderly scientist. Women shielded the aged victim, shouted for help, called out for anyone who might speak Russian to come and translate. 
</p>
<p>
Sergey fought back against the pull of many arms around him, grabbing at him, restraining him, forcing him down…
</p>
<p>
Just like he’d done so many years ago… When the men broke into his house on a frigid Saint Petersburg morning, with clouds of frost rising from his breath… When they’d knocked the gun from his hand, he grabbed a lamp, and bashed it against their skulls… And when they ripped the lamp away, he continued with his fists… His large, powerful muscles burning with adrenaline… His wife, Sveta, running to the nursery… And Rosie in her crib, crying, screaming… And Vadik, his son, six years old, fighting, biting, kicking, trying to fend them off with a plastic toy sword… His head reeled from the ether they’d tried to knock him out with… His vision spun, he could barely see, but he would not be subdued, not by these men, not when his family was at stake… And suddenly his entire skeleton rattled within his flesh as cattle prods stabbed into his ribs… And his chest felt like it was being crushed in a vise, and there was an aimless, arrhythmic fluttering from behind his sternum, and everything tilted and went black…
</p>
<p>
He picked one hand at random from the many that held him. He grabbed its wrist and gave a sharp, twisting yank. There was a soft crunching noise, and a man shrieking and screaming. The injured foe retreated, several people coming to his aid.
</p>
<p>
The sea of hands holding Sergey released him, and the crowd of vigilant citizens backed away in terror. A vacant ring surrounded him, none daring to come within his reach.
</p>
<p>
His eyes darted around the outdoor pavilion, looking for an escape. The narrow crisscrossing walkways, the rolling street carts, the convoluted networks of stairs and ramps throughout Pike Place Market would serve him well. But he had to move fast. Not only because the police were undoubtedly on their way, but because…
</p>
<p>
“Rosie,” he gasped. “My Rosie…!” He reached for the pocket where he typically kept his cellphone. It wasn’t there. He had destroyed it the previous night. “They’ll… Oh God…!”
</p>
<p>
He bolted from the pavilion. A few particularly brave people tried to stop him. He swept them aside like curtains.
</p>
<p>
Passinsky, straightening his shirt and gesturing graciously to the intervening bystanders to let them know he was alright, called out to him, “Sergey, don’t bother! I’m sure that he already has her.”
</p>
<p>
The old scientist’s choice of words was deliberate. In Russian, the verb “to have” is never used in reference to a woman or girl unless it is intended to convey a very specific implication.
</p>
