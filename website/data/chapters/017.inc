“Asperger’s?” Danny muttered
</span>
as they stepped down the interior stairs. “You told the guy I had Asperger’s?”
</p>
<p>
Jason shrugged. “The best lies are based on truth.”
</p>
<p>
In the space beneath the catwalk lay a naked mattress strewn with blankets. Large metal doors lined the adjacent wall.
</p>
<p>
“Julie, are you okay?” asked Jason.
</p>
<p>
Julie Yen grumbled, “What do you want?”
</p>
<p>
“Relax,” said Jason. “We’re friends.”
</p>
<p>
“Right,” she scoffed.
</p>
<p>
In the center of the room, a cylindrical glass vat sat atop a waist-high base covered with dials and buttons bearing readouts for temperature,pressure, salinity, and pH. Pipes, hoses, and valves ran along its side. The water inside was hazy like ocean brine. Large plastic jars labeled “L-Glutamine” were stacked nearby.
</p>
<p>
The back wall was lined with 55-gallon drums marked “Kerosene” and “Acetone,” with color-coded diamonds to indicate hazard ratings.
</p>
<p>
On a metal table sat an unmarked glass bottle of clear liquid, sealed with a stopper. Eye goggles and black rubber gloves lay beside it.
</p>
<p>
Danny reached his hand toward it.
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t touch that if I were you,” Julie called out.
</p>
<p>
“What is it?” Danny asked.
</p>
<p>
“Hydrochloric acid, eleven molar concentration. I told you idiots you only need three molar to stabilize the base. I’ll have to dilute the shit out of it.” She sighed. “Don’t know why I’m even stopping you. Go ahead, open it.”
</p>
<p>
Jason whispered, “Julie… Do you want to get out of here?”
</p>
<p>
Julie’s lip trembled. “I want…” she scowled up at the windows of the overhead office and screamed, “…my <em>fucking blow</em>!” She grabbed a nearby piece of cardboard and threw it weakly upwards. “It’s the best shit they’ve ever seen, and they fucking stole it! It’s mine, God damn it! Fuck…!” She threw herself down onto her mattress, sobbing like a petulant child.
</p>
<p>
Jason squatted beside her. “I brought something that might cheer you up.” He stretched his hand out, and for a moment her eyes grew bright and eager. 
</p>
<p>
When she saw the Eppendorf tube, she looked away uninterested.
</p>
<p>
“I thought you’d be happy to see it,” he said.
</p>
<p>
She turned away. “I’m such a fuck-up.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter?”
</p>
<p>
“This is all my fault,” she said. “I should have just done my job like a good little girl. I can’t do anything right.” She sniffled, and wiped her nose with her sleeve. “Your friend is gonna burn his hands off,” she added.
</p>
<p>
Danny was jabbing at the bottle with his HERF gun, watching the liquid jiggle back and forth. It looked like ordinary water, except for the fine white haze suspended just above its surface.
</p>
<p>
Julie shuffled toward him. Without a word, she donned the black rubber gloves, strapped the goggles over her face, and gently pulled out the stopper. A translucent trail of pale vapor wafted upward. 
</p>
<p>
She grabbed a scrap of cardboard from the floor and waved it over the bottle, passing it through the finger of fog.
</p>
<p>
Along the line of exposure, the cardboard blackened and charred. She gave the sheet a slight shake, and chunks crumbled to ash. She used the remains of the cardboard to wipe the stopper. Where it touched, the cardboard simply vanished. She re-sealed the bottle and removed her safety gear. “That’s why you don’t fuck with this stuff!”
</p>
<p>
Jason gestured to the equipment around them. “What’s all this for?”
</p>
<p>
“High-volume alkaloid extraction,” Julie said. “Let me see the sample.” Jason passed the Eppendorf tube into her hand. She held it up to her eyes and studied it. “It’s biofilming. That’s good. It’s supposed to.”
</p>
<p>
“Can you incubate it?” asked Jason.
</p>
<p>
“The second I finish a batch,” she said. “the Russians will bullet through my head.”
</p>
<p>
“I might be able to talk them into letting you go.”
</p>
<p>
“Fat chance.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s worth a try,” said Jason. “But tell me more about it first.”
</p>
<p>
Julie frowned. “Can you get me some blow?”
</p>
<p>
“Tell me what’s in the vial,” said Jason, “and I’ll see what I can do.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s a cocaine factory,” she said simply.
</p>
<p>
Jason looked around. “Yeah, I gathered that.”
</p>
<p>
Julie held up the vial. “No, this. <em>This</em> is a cocaine factory. You see those buckets of glutamine? You feed that stuff to these bacteria, and they poop out benzoylmethylecgonine.”
</p>
<p>
“Benzowhat?” said Jason.
</p>
<p>
“Benzoylmethylecgonine. Cocaine. The world’s best targeted dopamine reuptake inhibitor.”
</p>
<p>
Jason remained expressionless. “That L-Glutamine stuff…” he said, eyeing the purple labels on the jars. “Is it hard to get?”
</p>
<p>
Julie looked at Jason with a face usually directed at the kid in class who eats paste. “It’s <em>glutamine</em>. It’s forty bucks a pound at any GNC store. Cheaper if you buy in bulk. And it converts to cocaine at almost 100% yield. So you’re basically making cocaine at ninety bucks a kilo.”
</p>
<p>
“So, you incubate the germs in that vial, then you pour in that glutamine stuff, and then suddenly you have cocaine?”
</p>
<p>
“More or less,” said Julie. “I mean, there’s a little more to it. You have to give it time to let the enzymes act, but after that you can process it just like leaves from a coca plant. Mix it with kerosene, grind it into a paste, separate with acetone, blah blah blah. The process kills the bacteria, so you need to keep a pure mother broth around. But in a nutshell, yeah.”
</p>
<p>
Danny interrupted, “Wait, let me get this straight. This whole night, I’ve been chasing after some kind of germ that’s been injected with the gene for cocaine?”
</p>
<p>
Julie rolled her eyes. “There is no ‘gene for cocaine’. Cocaine isn’t a protein. It’s a crystalline tropane alkaloid. Do you have any idea how complicated its biosynthesis process is?”
</p>
<p>
“Umm… no?” Danny replied.
</p>
<p>
“Look, cellular machinery can’t create cocaine through normal gene expression,” said Julie. “But cellular machinery <em>can</em> create enzymes to catalyze the conversion of precursors. That’s what happens in <em>Erythroxylon coca</em> &mdash; the coca plant. There’s about sixteen steps in the natural biosynthesis of benzoylmethylecgonine. Those steps are catalyzed by about two dozen enzymes, six of which consist of multiple peptide chains and two of which are themselves synthesized by other enzymes… The point is, unlike cocaine, enzymes <em>are</em> proteins. Enzymes <em>do</em> have genetic encodings. Which meeeeeans…” She paused, hoping that the implication would be obvious. The two men stared at her blankly. “…Which <em>means</em> that we can sequence those genes in the coca plant, and then splice them into <em>E. coli</em>. So the <em>E. coli</em> thinks they’re part of its own genome, and translates them into proteins. Got it?”
</p>
<p>
Danny nodded brightly. “Yeah!”
</p>
<p>
Julie cocked an eyebrow. “Really?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes!” Danny declared. “It’s just like a DLL hijacking attack! Like a computer virus.”
</p>
<p>
Jason stared at her quizzically. “You gene-spliced a coca plant into a laboratory germ to create a cocaine-producing bio-machine? That sounds like one hell of an engineering accomplishment.”
</p>
<p>
“Recombinant genetics isn’t for sissies,” she replied proudly.
</p>
<p>
“So,” Jason asked, “how much of this genetic engineering did you perform on your own?”
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?” Julie replied.
</p>
<p>
“How did <em>you</em> get that vial?” Jason prodded.
</p>
<p>
“I told you!” Julie said defiantly. “By sequencing the <em>Erythroxylon coca</em> genome…”
</p>
<p>
“That answers how <em>Tungsten</em> created it,” said Jason. “It doesn’t answer how <em>you</em> ended up with it. Look, I don’t know much about science, but I do know about personnel management. The kind of engineering effort you’re describing would take years, even for a team of world-class researchers. You did <em>not</em> create it on your own as some intern summer project.”
</p>
<p>
“They couldn’t have finished it without me!” she protested.
</p>
<p>
“Right. They needed <em>you</em> to sequence the coca plant genome. They needed <em>you</em> to splice the genes into the <em>E. coli</em> strain…”
</p>
<p>
Julie glared at him. “I’m a key member of the research staff!”
</p>
<p>
“You’re a college sophomore.”
</p>
<p>
“God, shut the fuck up!” She stormed back to her mattress in a huff.
</p>
<p>
Jason sat down beside her. After giving her a few moments to cool off, he asked her gently, “Tell me how it went down.”
</p>
<p>
She picked idly at a loose thread. “Creating cocaine-producing <em>E. coli</em> wasn’t just some side-project. It’s the whole point of Tungsten. This vial is everything they’ve been working for.”
</p>
<p>
“And they entrusted it to their intern?”
</p>
<p>
“Genetic engineering isn’t an exact science. It’s not like we can reach inside a cell’s nucleus with little tweezers, you know? Getting a gene from one organism into another is a messy process. We use special chemicals called restriction enzymes to chop out the genes we want from the source organism. Each different restriction enzyme binds to one specific nucleotide sequence and cuts the DNA strand there. So, if we’ve sequenced a gene, then we can pour in a restriction enzyme that binds to the beginning of the gene and another that binds to the end, and the gene floats out into the solution. But a lot of other unwanted chunks of DNA also float out along with it. You then have to fool an <em>E. coli</em> bacterium into absorbing these chunks into its own genome. It’s tricky because bacteria have evolved restriction modification systems to protect themselves from foreign DNA…”
</p>
<p>
“Ooh!” Danny interrupted. “Just like Intrusion Prevention Systems on computer networks! I just learned about those today.”
</p>
<p>
Julie blinked at him and shrugged. “Anyway. To fool a bacterium into adopting foreign DNA, you have to wrap the new gene into a plasmid, or load it into a bacteriophage virus, and so on. Oh, <em>and</em> you have to create some way to separate the <em>E. coli</em> that <em>do</em> absorb your new gene from the ones that don’t. Like with something called a ‘screenable marker’ which is where we add a gene for bioluminescence to make the desired bacteria glow in the dark. Because, don’t forget, we don’t actually <em>see</em> what we’re working with &mdash; all we’re doing is mixing liquids and keeping our fingers crossed.”
</p>
<p>
“So, what you’re saying,” said Jason, “is that it’s very hit-or-miss work. You can do everything right, and in the end your germs don’t absorb any new DNA. Or they do, but it wasn’t what you were hoping for &mdash; it was some junk DNA instead.”
</p>
<p>
“Right,” said Julie. “Or they got the right DNA, but put it somewhere in the genome where it can’t be expressed.”
</p>
<p>
“Which means you have to mix up another batch and try again, right?” said Jason.
</p>
<p>
“Over and over,” said Julie. “And that’s just for <em>one</em> gene. The metabolic pathway for cocaine synthesis has about forty. It’s mostly done by robots. But you have to do follow-up tests by hand.”
</p>
<p>
Jason smiled. “Yes. I get it now. That’s exactly the kind of task… that they’d give an intern. So the scientists ran hundreds of thousands of these batches… and you were the first one to spot a success.”
</p>
<p>
Julie nodded. “It was my job to check on them. The other scientists couldn’t be bothered with something so mundane. So, yeah, when one of the batches finally produced an <em>E. coli</em> strain that was expressing <em>all</em> the cocaine biosynthesis genes, I was the first to see it.”
</p>
<p>
“And you were supposed to call in the senior researchers,” Jason surmised. “But instead, you…”
</p>
<p>
“Yeah. I just… you know…”
</p>
<p>
“Took it.”
</p>
<p>
Julie nodded. “They started to realize that something was up. Damned if I know how. Sensor data from the robots, maybe? They were just starting to suspect me after a couple weeks. But by then I’d already started making my own batches and dealing… And the rest of the story is…”
</p>
<p>
Jason looked around the room, at the naked mattress and the unwashed, pajama-clad girl. “Yeah.”
</p>
<p>
Julie rolled backward and curled up on her side in a fetal position, the Eppendorf tube held between her palms.
</p>
<p>
Jason watched her in silence. Danny wandered toward the vat in the middle of the room. 
</p>
<p>
Quietly, Jason asked her, “Are you okay?”
</p>
<p>
“No!” she answered. “No, I’m not fucking okay! God, I don’t understand why everything has to be so fucking hard! Nothing I do ever fucking works! Nothing is ever good enough! I get a full scholarship to the University of Washington and my parents are like, ‘Why not Berkeley or MIT?’ I score 97% on my organic chemistry final, and they go, ‘How could you miss those three percent?’ I work so fucking hard, just to feel the slightest shred of pride and accomplishment… All I want is to be able to enjoy the feeling of knowing that I did <em>something</em> right. <em>Anything</em>. I just wanted one big score, just prove to the world, ‘Look at me, fuckers! I win! I don’t care what you say! I <em>am</em> good enough!’… Can… Can you… Please get me some coke now?”
</p>
<p>
Jason paused, and said, “Okay, Julie. I’ll see what I can do. But first… I want you to explain one more thing to me.”
</p>
<p>
She bolted back up furiously. “Oh fuck, come on!”
</p>
<p>
“You’ve told me the <em>how</em>, but not the <em>why</em>. Tungsten was working full-time to develop this transgenic cocaine dispenser. But from a business perspective, that doesn’t make any sense. The end product is illegal to sell. What was Tungsten’s market strategy?”
</p>
<p>
“You mean like how to make money off of it?” asked Julie. “Fuck if I know. I was just on the science end of things. All I know are rumors. If I tell, will you get me some coke already?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Jason.
</p>
<p>
“Promise?”
</p>
<p>
“Pinky-swear.”
</p>
<p>
“Fine,” she grumbled. “Doctor P. never talked about it, but the other scientists had some ideas. They believe the future of psychopharmacology is dopamine.”
</p>
<p>
“Dopamine?” asked Jason.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a neurotransmitter &mdash; a chemical in your brain,” said Julie. “It’s the main hormone found in a part of the brain called the nucleus accumbens, the ‘pleasure center’ or ‘reward center’. Dopamine also runs a shitload of other stuff in your brain, but we figure the reward pathway is sort of the key to it all.”
</p>
<p>
“How’s it connected to cocaine?” asked Jason.
</p>
<p>
“Cocaine is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor,” she said. “You’ve heard of SSRIs, right? Selective <em>serotonin</em> reuptake inhibitors? Like Lexapro, Zoloft, Paxil, that kind of thing?”
</p>
<p>
“I’ve heard the term,” said Jason. “Antidepressants?”
</p>
<p>
“Right,” said Julie. “See, the pharmaceutical industry’s gotten pretty good at managing this one brain hormone called serotonin. Basically, increasing serotonin levels in certain parts of the brain makes people feel calmer and more mellow. In the 1950s, research chemists at a French company called Rhône-Poulenc were working on antihistamines, and they accidentally stumbled onto a class of drugs called tricyclics. Turned out that tricyclics jam up the brain’s serotonin-draining machinery. Brain cells work by squirting neurotransmitters at each other across an intracellular gap called a synapse. After each neural impulse, the presynaptic neuron sucks back up all the hormone it just squirted &mdash; it cleans up after itself, basically. These tricyclic chemicals happen to be shaped, on a molecular level, just barely enough like serotonin to fit into the reuptake pump &mdash; but not enough to pass all the way through it. So the presynaptic neuron sucks up a tricyclic molecule thinking it’s serotonin, and the tricyclic gets stuck in the pump. So the presynaptic neuron can’t suck up any more serotonin because its pumps are jammed, and the serotonin ends up just sort of pooling in the synapse and triggering the postsynaptic neuron over and over. The end result is a major increase in serotonergic activity.”
</p>
<p>
“Okay, but what does that have to do with cocaine?” said Jason. “Cocaine <em>isn’t</em> an SSRI, right? Cocaine works on…”
</p>
<p>
“Dopamine,” said Julie. “There’s a new class of drugs called <em>D</em>RIs &mdash; <em>dopamine</em> reuptake inhibitors. They were created by researchers who saw what tricyclics did with serotonin and were like, ‘Hey, let’s pull the same trick with dopamine!’ Dopamine is what the brain’s reward centers run on. So while modulating serotonin would simply make people feel calm, modulating <em>dopamine</em> could drastically change people’s behavioral motivators. That’s how you get things on the market now like Wellbutrin and Ritalin and Adderall.”
</p>
<p>
“And cocaine?” Jason tried.
</p>
<p>
“Cocaine is the <em>original</em> DRI,” said Julie. “What all these DRIs do artificially, the coca plant does through natural evolution. Cocaine screws directly with the reward pathway. Like, if you ace a test at school, the bolt of satisfaction when you see that A+ is the stimulation of the reward pathway. Or if you’re playing a sport and you score a point and you feel the thrill of victory. When the pathway activates, it sensitizes neural channels that correspond to whatever you’re doing at the time &mdash; it makes you more likely to make the decision to do it again. So the rush you feel when you ace a test makes you more likely to choose to study in the future; when you score a goal, it makes you willing to practice more. Dopamine drives the positive feedback system that makes the cognitive machinery of the brain do more of what works and less of what doesn’t.”
</p>
<p>
Jason nodded. “And cocaine throws this reward system into overdrive.”
</p>
<p>
“Exactly,” Julie said. “Cocaine prevents the neurons in the pathway from cleaning up after themselves, so there’s dopamine overflowing everywhere.”
</p>
<p>
“Which inclines the cocaine user to do more of whatever they were doing to make that happen…” said Jason.
</p>
<p>
“…Which happens to be snorting lines of coke,” concluded Julie.
</p>
<p>
Jason nodded soberly. “Sounds like a vicious cycle.”
</p>
<p>
Julie looked up at him. She tried to smile, but the corners of her mouth twitched downward. “They do say the stuff’s addictive.”
</p>
<p>
“So how do these new dopamine-based medicines <em>heal</em> rather than harm?” said Jason.
</p>
<p>
“There’s some emerging theories that tweaking the reward pathways can help treat a wide variety of cognitive and psychological problems,” said Julie. “Like, a lot of DRIs are used to manage Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Nobody really knows why they work on ADHD, but one theory says that classroom hyperactivity is just the natural action of a child’s brain searching their environment for a ‘fix’. They’re also used for Social Anxiety Disorder, to help people who feel awkward or uncomfortable around other people &mdash; the idea there is that their reward pathway doesn’t get enough stimulation from personal interaction. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.”
</p>
<p>
“So what you’re saying is, there’s a lot of potential market applications for this new class of vaguely cocaine-like medicines, just waiting to be explored,” Jason said.
</p>
<p>
“Yeah. There’s a lot of people that dopamine reuptake inhibitors can help,” said Julie.
</p>
<p>
“Like who?” Jason asked.
</p>
<p>
“People who are a little bit ‘off’,” Julie answered. Anybody that’s obsessive, or neurotic, or socially awkward, or prone to drifting off into daydreams.”
</p>
<p>
Jason smiled and said, “Oh, really…?” His head slowly swiveled to look at Danny.
</p>
<p>
Danny was crouching next to the cylindrical vat, gazing at the cloudy water. “Periscope down, ensign!” he said. “Helmsman, begin descent!” He pushed down on a protrusion, announcing, “Aye aye, captain!” He reached an arm around to the other side, and made kicking motions with two fingers. “Dive team! Dive team, do you copy?” Placing his other hand partly over his mouth, he made heavy breathing noises. “Aye, captain! No sign of the treasure yet…!”
</p>
<p>
Jason wordlessly brought his palm to his face and shook his head.
</p>
<p>
Julie batted at Jason’s shoulder. “So, we had a deal…”
</p>
<p>
Jason sighed, and stood up with a grunt. “I’ll go talk to that Rex guy upstairs. Thank you, Julie. You’ve been… helpful.”
</p>
</div>

<div class="chapsection">
<p>
<span class="caplead">Captain Danny was guiding his submarine</span> through the treacherous Vat Sea when his crew encountered an enormous sea monster. From Captain Danny’s perspective, the creature looked like a horizontally stretched human face, almost like that of a young Asian woman as seen through the lens-warping effect of a water-filled cylinder.
</p>
<p>
“Do you mind?” said the aquatic beast. “I set the environment for optimal growth conditions. Don’t screw it up.”
</p>
<p>
Danny stood and looked at Julie over the vat. She regained normal human proportions. “Sorry. It’s been a crazy day. I could really use some sleep.”
</p>
<p>
“Heh, I know something white and powdery that can fix that,” she said with a conspiratorial smirk.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t do drugs,” Danny asserted. “I hate the idea of fucking with my brain.”
</p>
<p>
Julie laughed at him. “Why? Because your neuroanatomy is some sort of sacred thing? Because your cognitive processes can’t use a bit of… reconfiguration? Just ask yourself one simple question: do you <em>really</em> think that your brain &mdash; <em>your</em> brain, in particular &mdash; is nearly as precise and fine-tuned a machine as you think it is?”
</p>
<p>
Above them, the office door opened. Jason descended the stairs. Rex closely followed with gun in hand.
</p>
<p>
Julie kept her eyes fixed on them. “Well?”
</p>
<p>
Rex sat down on the folding chair. He put his gun across his lap, produced something from his pocket, and hunched over the tabletop. Danny could hear quick tapping noises on the table’s metal surface.
</p>
<p>
Julie’s face lit up in an ecstatic grin. She drew a quick breath of unbearable anticipation. With her small body and her oversized t-shirt, she looked like a child beaming at the sight of presents under the tree on a wintry white Christmas morning. But for her, the greatest present of all was the snow. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="chapsection">
<p>
<span class="caplead">Julie threw her arms around Jason,</span> squealing, “Thank you! Thank you!” Jason grimly accepted the gratitude for a few moments before pushing her away.
</p>
<p>
Rex cleared some room to work. The clear unlabeled bottle sat on one side of the table, next to the goggles and the rubber gloves. Rex hunched over the tabletop, and laid down a crumpled square of Saran wrap a few inches on each side. In the middle of the plastic wrap lay a tightly packed pile of white powder. Rex poured some of the powder out onto the table, and used a razor blade to carefully chop it and draw it out into lines. The razor blade made quick tap-tap-taps, punctuated by smooth slicing sounds as he dragged the drug into parallel rails.
</p>
<p>
“You got any idea how much trouble I’d be in if the boss-man found out?” the scruffy blond man grumbled as he worked. “We’re in lockdown. I was supposed to flush this.”
</p>
<p>
Julie stared transfixed at the thin white lines as they materialized underneath the razorblade. Her expression bore the eagerness of Pavlov’s dogs upon hearing a bell.
</p>
<p>
Four long rails of coke lay drawn across the shiny gray tabletop. He withdrew a dollar bill from his pocket and rolled it into a tight tube. He sat up straight, tossed his long stringy blond hair behind his head, and prepared for his hit by closing his eyes and breathing a deep, calm exhale. Then, in a smooth motion, he brought the rolled-up dollar bill to one nostril, bowed his head down, and traced the end of the dollar bill along the bottom-most line while inhaling. The granules disappeared from the table up into the green tube. When the line was finished, he pitched his head back with his eyes closed and emitted a slow, satisfied sigh. 
</p>
<p>
Julie tried to body-check him off of the chair. “My turn!”
</p>
<p>
Rex pushed her away, grabbed his gun, and pointed it at her. “Mind your manners, little lady! Guests first. Gentlemen?”
</p>
<p>
Danny stood petrified. Jason shook his head.
</p>
<p>
Rex eyed Jason with a hint of suspicion. “Numbers? You don’t want any?”
</p>
<p>
“No thanks, Rex,” said Jason. “Umm… Diggitty’s on all sorts of medication, so he can’t have any. And me, I’m too old to get much out of it anymore.”
</p>
<p>
“You sure?” Rex persisted. “It’s great stuff.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t get a high from coke,” said Jason. “I just get a headache.”
</p>
<p>
Rex grunted, “Well shit. I hope I never get <em>that</em> old.”
</p>
<p>
Julie stood by like a cat at a sushi bar. Rex grudgingly muttered permission, and rose from the folding chair. He had barely gotten his rear off of the seat before she slid in and grabbed the razorblade and rolled-up dollar bill. She dove straight into the next line on the table, snorting it up as quickly as her breath would allow. She dropped the dollar bill and held her hands over her mouth and nose. She held her breath for several seconds, looking like she was about to sneeze. Tears built up in her eyes. Her accelerating pulse was visible in her ears.  
</p>
<p>
After almost a minute of sitting motionless, she finally made a sound: a euphoric, delighted, childlike laugh.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t feel my face!” she giggled, and traced her fingers sensuously across her mouth and cheeks.
</p>
<p>
Jason watched her indulge. “Listen, Julie. You still have the vial, right?”
</p>
<p>
Julie sat in unresponsive bliss.
</p>
<p>
“Julie, the vial…” he persisted.
</p>
<p>
She abruptly turned. “Dude I can hear you just fine, shut the fuck up,” she snapped, her voice rapid and energetic. “Can’t a girl enjoy a freakin’ high? It’s my first hit in like a week, so let me fucking roll with it, okay? Christ. Buzzkill.”
</p>
<p>
“Part of the deal I struck with Rex,” said Jason, “is that you’d start the incubation.”
</p>
<p>
She guffawed. “Well fuck that! He’s going to shoot me the minute I finish a batch.”
</p>
<p>
Rex rolled his wide-pupilled eyes. “I keep telling you, bitch. If you behave, nobody’s going to shoot you. Fuck, I’ll shoot you if you <em>don’t</em> make a batch sooner or later.”
</p>
<p>
“Fine, fine,” said the girl. “Let me do the rest of these lines and I’ll go pop it in the tank.” Her head again swooped down to the table. Another white rail disappeared.
</p>
<p>
This time, instead of holding her face, her eyes darted back and forth, looking at the objects on the tabletop. She fidgeted with her hands, and occasionally glanced over her shoulder towards Rex.
</p>
<p>
“Are you okay?” asked Danny.
</p>
<p>
“I’m fine,” she said quickly.
</p>
<p>
“You look agitated,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“I’m just thinking…” she replied.
</p>
<p>
From outside, past the large double doors on the opposite side of the factory, came the sound of an engine, followed by car doors opening and closing.
</p>
<p>
The dreadlocked guard said something beyond the wall. His words weren’t clear, but sounded surprised.
</p>
<p>
Another voice answered in a Russian accent. “…Tonight is complete cluster of fucks!…”

Danny recognized the voice. It was the voice that he had heard on the stolen cellphone. The voice of Sergey Mukhayev.
</p>
<p>
Rex froze in place. “Oh… shit…”
</p>
<p>
A third voice rose from behind the doors. Danny recognized it as the voice of the man from the Tungsten hallway: Eugene Mukhayev. “That’s the car! That’s their fucking car!”
</p>
<p>
Jason gulped, and backed toward the rear wall, behind the steel drums.
</p>
<p>
Rex sprang to life. “We’ve got to get rid of the coke! I wasn’t supposed to give you any! I’m not even supposed to have any. Fuck…”
</p>
<p>
Julie, still fidgeting, grabbed clumsily at the square of Saran wrap. While handing it to Rex, she carefully enunciated, “Whoops!”, and fumbled the open packet of powder. The drug spilled onto the floor, forming a conspicuous pile on the floor. She swept the remaining cocaine from the table down after it.
</p>
<p>
“Oh fuck me!” Rex said, almost panicking. He bent down next to Julie and began sweeping the powder out of sight.
</p>
<p>
“What I was thinking about,” said Julie, speaking rapidly, “was that dopamine is active in more than just the nucleus accumbens. You know where else it’s found?”
</p>
<p>
Jason, his voice dry with fear, said, “Julie, I don’t think we have time for…”
</p>
<p>
“The substantia nigra,” said the girl. “It’s a part of your brain that controls movement. It’s the part that deteriorates in people with Parkinson’s disease. The pleasure centers might shape your desires, but the substantia nigra affects what you actually <em>do</em> about those desires.”
</p>
<p>
“Julie, please!” Jason implored. “Just help us think of a way out of here!”
</p>
<p>
Outside, the voices argued. “Nothing? What do you mean, nothing?” shouted Sergey. The guard replied, “They scrubbed the car, boss. They even pulled off their VIN tags.”
</p>
<p>
“Now, what’s interesting about the substantia nigra,” Julie continued, “is that it functions by lateral inhibition. It takes all the possible different things you can do at any given moment, and chooses one based on learned reward expectation. See, your cerebral cortex comes up with dozens of different courses of action, all the time, every second you’re awake. Blink now or blink later? Left foot forward or right foot forward? Say ‘hello’ or say ‘goodbye’?…”
</p>
<p>
Rex, his face pale, kept sweeping desperately at the floor. “Fuck fuck fuck! He’s gonna know…”
</p>
<p>
Danny watched the Asian girl’s hands as she talked. He noticed a pattern to her movements. She wasn’t fidgeting. She was rehearsing.
</p>
<p>
“…But of all those actions you’re thinking of taking all the time,” Julie resumed, “only one ever wins out. And it’s the substantia nigra that makes the selection. Of all the hypothetical bodily movements you can possibly take, the substantia nigra chooses which one will get to activate the muscles. And the substantia nigra runs on dopamine.”
</p>
<p>
“Julie!” Jason barked. “Either help or shut up!”
</p>
<p>
From the alley, the voice of Sergey commanded, “You stay here! Guard door like you were supposed to! Eugene and I go take care of this ourselves.” 
</p>
<p>
Footsteps ascended the stairs outside.
</p>
<p>
Danny, his head spinning from fear, gasped, “Julie, what’s your point?”
</p>
<p>
Suddenly she stopped moving and locked eyes with Danny. “My point,” she said slowly, “is that dopamine is the substance that converts thought into action.”
</p>
<p>
She turned to look down at Rex on the floor hiding the mess of cocaine. She gave him an innocent smile. “And do you know what I’m thinking right now?” she asked him sweetly.
</p>
<p>
“What?” the pock-skinned, long-haired  man growled, looking up from his crouched position next to her chair.
</p>
<p>
And she reached across the table, grabbed the clear unlabeled bottle, pulled out the stopper, and poured half a liter of hydrochloric acid down onto his face.
