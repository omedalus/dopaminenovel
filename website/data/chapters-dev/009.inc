<span class="caplead">In the periphery of her vision</span>, something moved. Tina swore she saw a shadow glide across the adjoining hallway. If Tina hadn’t looked down from the last camera at that exact moment, she would have missed it entirely. 
</p>
<p>
Yet the corridor was dark. A split second later, she saw nothing.
</p>
<p>
She walked from the bullpen and peeked down the hallway. A slight amount of light and noise was coming from around a corner.
</p>
<p>
Tina walked to the bend in the hallway. She saw light pouring from the doorway to the cold-storage room, where Tungsten kept samples of <em>E. coli</em> bacteria in suspended animation. She heard someone in there, rummaging through glassware.
</p>
<p>
Tina walked uncertainly toward the lit room. The hum of whirring HVAC machinery and the sound of clinking glassware grew louder as she approached. The door was open, and a chilly breeze poured from it.
</p>
<p>
She peeked inside. The door to the deep-freeze unit was open. Amidst the cold fog pouring out onto the floor, Tina could see a pair of black sneakers under the door, and could hear someone rifling through the test tubes filled with frozen <em>E. coli</em> samples inside.
</p>
<p>
Tina watched for just a moment too long.
</p>
<p>
The black gloved fingers of a man’s hand wrapped around the edge of the steel door and pulled it shut. The room got slightly quieter as the massive door’s rubber gasket muffled the hum of the deep-freezer’s cooling pumps.
</p>
<p>
She saw the man standing there, breathing into his gloved hands to recover from the cold. He wasn’t one of the scientists. He was muscular and athletic, in jeans and a dark jacket. He was in his late twenties or early thirties, and sported dark crew-cut hair. A Bluetooth earpiece sat in his ear. His expression was hard and resolute, and something about his face and posture hinted to her that he was no stranger to physical violence.
</p>
<p>
He saw her.
</p>
<p>
They looked at each other tensely.
</p>
<p>
Tina had left her iPhone in her purse at her desk. Her first instinct told her to sprint back to her lobby, call the police, and get the hell out of the building. Except she couldn’t, because he was staring at her.
</p>
<p>
She stepped out from behind the door. The only thing she could think to say to him was her receptionist program. “Hi. Can I help you?”
</p>
<p>
He replied to her in a foreign accent. The same accent, albeit much lighter, as Dr. Passinsky’s. Russian. “I’m from the courier service. I’m here to pick up a delivery for urgent shipment tomorrow. Has to arrive first thing in the morning. Sorry to bother you.”
</p>
<p>
As he spoke, he gazed at her like a wolf at a rabbit. Tina felt an intense tightness in her chest, a mortal intimidation that froze her in place. “I’m supposed to sign visitors in at the front desk,” she said tentatively.
</p>
<p>
“Not necessary,” said the man, his eyes boring a hole through her. “I belong here. I have the keycard.” 
</p>
<p>
She stood immobile in the doorway, forcing herself to remain calm. “Well. Then. Good luck with the delivery. I’ll just go back to my desk now and finish my work. Okay?”
</p>
<p>
He stared at her silently. He said nothing in response.
</p>
<p>
“Okay?” she repeated, trying not to sound like she was pleading.
</p>
<p>
Finally, he said, “Okay.”
</p>
<p>
She resisted the urge to breathe a sigh of relief. She’d pretend to believe him about his deliveryman story, he’d pretend to believe her about believing it, and they’d both let the night proceed under this pleasant little fiction. “Okay,” she repeated with a nod, and slowly started backing out from the doorway. 
</p>
<p>
“You know what?” the man said suddenly. “I change my mind.”
</p>
<p>
With a quick, soundless motion, the man reached into his jacket, pulled out a gun, and pointed it at Tina. The gun was a small silver revolver, barely larger than his hand. The barrel was short and stubby, but its barrel looked wide enough to stick a finger into. 
</p>
<p>
“Get in here, young lady,” he commanded. With a practiced flick of his thumb, managing to keep the squat barrel perfectly still, he cocked the revolver’s hammer back. It made a faint click.
</p>
<p>
She stepped into the room.
</p>
<p>
“Good girl,” he said as he carefully uncocked the hammer. “Now come over here.” 
</p>
<p>
He backed away several feet, keeping the gun trained on her as she walked toward the deep-freezer.
</p>
<p>
“That refrigerator,” he said to her, bobbing his head at the deep-freezer. “That’s long-term storage for microbe samples, yes?”
</p>
<p>
Tina nodded.
</p>
<p>
“Open it.”
</p>
<p>
She reluctantly grabbed the handle of the deep-freezer’s massive metal door and yanked. The door’s rubber gasket released its airtight seal, letting the cryogenic air spill into the room. Standing in front of the open door felt like being stabbed with thousands of tiny needle-sharp shards of ice.
</p>
<p>
“You know, I really am here for pickup,” the man said casually. “Your friend Julie &mdash; you know Julie, yes? &mdash; She left something here, that is really better left with someone else. Now, about you, I’m thinking maybe you could be useful. You want to be useful, yes?”
</p>
<p>
“What do you want?” Tina croaked out, shivering.
</p>
<p>
“Tell me,” said the crew-cut man with the Russian accent and the small revolver, “what the fuck is an Eppendorf tube?”
</p>

<p>
<span class="caplead">Satish smacked the cellphone</span> out of Mike’s hand before he could dial 9-1-1. “No cops!” he commanded.
</p>
<p>
“We have to, Satish!” said Mike. “Look at this crazy shit. What, are we just going to sit here? We have to call the cops!”
</p>
<p>
“Yeah, right,” Satish mocked. “And tell them what, exactly? ‘Oh, hi, me and my Dungeons and Dragons buddies were just out here hacking into this company, when we saw some scary stuff going on through their video feed that we happened to crack.’ Have you forgotten that what we’re doing out here is illegal too?”
</p>
<p>
“You’re being paranoid,” said Mike.
</p>
<p>
“No, I’m being <em>real</em>,” Satish fired back. “We’re not playing some video game here, Mike! We don’t get to screw up. We don’t get to undo. We don’t get save-points. If we get hauled off in the back of a squad car, we don’t get to see some menu screen saying, ‘Mission Failed. Retry Level?’ And if there’s something we didn’t consider, some factor that we don’t account for and didn’t even know we’re <em>supposed</em> to account for, we’re all completely fucked, permanently, forever. There’s no Control-Z, there’s no Reload. We don’t get to say, ‘Okay well next time we just won’t do that,’ because there won’t <em>be</em> a next time.”
</p>
<p>
“All I’m talking about here is calling the cops,” said Mike.
</p>
<p>
“And all <em>I’m</em> talking about,” Satish countered, “is erring on the side of caution. I’m talking about minding our own fucking business.”
</p>
<p>
Jason and Danny were watching the events in the cold-storage room on Danny’s laptop. They could hear Satish’s and Mike’s conversation from outside the car through the open window. “He’s talking about unknown unknowns,” Jason said to them with a slow nod. “And minimization of risk profile.” Jason looked at the laptop screen with a puckered frown. “He’s right. No cops. There’s too much at stake for us.”
</p>
<p>
Mike shook his head. “But that girl in there is&mdash;” 
</p>
<p>
“Is not our fucking problem!” Satish insisted. 
</p>
<p>
“So what do you suggest we do?” demanded Mike.
</p>
<p>
“Nothing,” said Satish dismissively. “There’s nothing we <em>can</em> do. Not without risking our own necks.”
</p>
<p>
“So, what?” Mike shot back. “We just sit here watching on our laptops like a bunch of useless shitballs?”
</p>
<p>
“Uh, maybe you haven’t noticed, but this team <em>is</em> a bunch of useless shitballs,” said Satish. “And, you know, with a stupid asshole like Danny in charge, it’s not even really a surprise. The guy hand-holds you through a bunch of script kiddie attacks, and then sucks your dicks and tells you you’re all awesome brilliant hackers. And that’s fine, up to the point at which being a dumbass can get you in real trouble &mdash; fines and jail for you, deportation for me. And we’re at that point now. So, yes, Mike, all we do is we sit here. Because the alternative is taking a chance of completely fucking up the entire rest of your life. And it’s all because you don’t want to feel like a ‘useless shitball’? Boo fucking hoo. There’s worse things in this world than feeling useless.”
</p>
<p>
Danny heard Satish’s voice through the car window. Satish’s words hit Danny like a claw around his throat. He shoved his laptop aside on the asphalt and stood up, dizzy, choking, his mind swirling with rage and hate. Hate at the world, hate at himself, hate at his past, hate at his present, hate at his thousands of unrealized could-have-beens.
</p>
<p>
“No, Satish,” said Danny. “There isn’t.”
</p>
<p>
“Danny, just shut the fuck up,” said Satish. “Seriously. Nobody gives a shit about anything you have to say.”
</p>
<p>
“Okay, <em>that’s it</em>!” said Danny.
</p>
<p>
In his brain, something popped. Danny’s vision of the world suddenly shifted, simplified. An invigorating feeling washed over him in an instant. He felt like he had been seeing the world through a dirty, grimy window, and somebody just sprayed a high-pressure water hose through his head. The muck of apprehension and self-doubt that clouded his mind dissolved in a hot, cleansing spray of adrenaline and testosterone. The world was suddenly a very straightforward place, with a clear, simple task that needed to get done: Satish seriously needed a few teeth busted in.
</p>
<p>
Danny threw open the door of the Navigator and grabbed Satish’s arm with both hands. Satish tried to pull his arm away from him, but Danny’s grip was tight enough that Satish succeeded only in pulling himself closer. Danny responded by quickly twisting Satish’s arm almost to the point of breaking. Satish howled in pain and, amid a torrent of curses, hopped out of the car. 
</p>
<p>
Danny wasted no time in grabbing him by his shoulders, slamming him up against the SUV, and drawing back his fist in preparation for a blow straight to the face.
</p>
<p>
Danny held his fist wound back, his other hand pressing Satish by the shoulder and neck against the body of the Navigator. He had never hit a grown man before. He would be happy to let Satish be his first. 
</p>
<p>
Satish’s face was turned and flinching, his arms raised limply in front of him. He batted a bit in Danny’s direction, but he wasn’t actually fighting back. He wriggled a little against the press of Danny’s left hand, a press he could easily slip out of if he would just put some force into it. But Satish wasn’t taking any decisive actions, neither to fight nor to block nor to escape. He just stood there, holding up his arms loosely and ineffectually.
</p>
<p>
Danny didn’t punch him. Disgusted, he pushed himself away from Satish and the Navigator.
</p>
<p>
“Christ,” said Danny. “Do you have any idea how pathetic you are?”
</p>
<p>
“You’re a complete fucking nutcase!” Satish said. His bravado was unconvincing.
</p>
<p>
“And <em>you’re</em> a complete fucking loser,” Danny retorted. “You talk nonstop about how everybody around you is so much dumber than you, but when it comes time to put your smarts into action, what do you do? Jack shit. All you ever do is sit around playing Xbox and your fucking fantasy role-playing games, wanking about being some imaginary hero in a far-off land. But when the real world gives you a chance to actually do something that matters, all you use that brain and imagination for is to make up retarded excuses about why <em>not</em> to go for it.”
</p>
<p>
“Fuck you, man!” Satish said with a quavering voice. “You don’t know what you’re talking about!”
</p>
<p>
“Prove me wrong, then!” Danny stepped up to Satish with his arms loose and wide out. “Come on! Show me you can do <em>anything</em> other than talk. Go ahead.”
</p>
<p>
Satish squirmed away. “I don’t have to prove anything to you!” he whimpered.
</p>
<p>
Danny snorted with contempt. “You just did.”
</p>
<p>
A moment of silence passed.
</p>
<p>
Danny noticed Mike and Moshen poking their heads out the door of the Navigator. Their jaws were hanging open.
</p>
<p>
He looked at his laptop. At the Tungsten building. At the men in his team.
</p>
<p>
“Guys, we’re still here to do a job,” he said to them. “And instead of bailing out, I think we can use this situation as an opportunity. We’re here to steal Tungsten’s secrets, right? Well, those two guys don’t look like they’re here for the girl. They’re here for something else. Something in that freezer. And whatever it is, it’s obviously valuable. I say we take it.”
</p>
<p>
Jason asked cautiously, “What do you mean, Danny? Just go in and grab it?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” Danny said simply. “And get the girl out of there, too. And do it all without calling the cops.”
</p>
<p>
“Danny, have you lost your mind?” Jason said. “They’ll <em>kill you</em>.”
</p>
<p>
Danny shrugged. “I’d rather die doing something than live doing nothing.”
</p>
<p>
Jason stared at him aghast.
</p>
<p>
“Look, don’t worry,” said Danny. “I don’t plan to get myself killed. I can out-maneuver them in there.”
</p>
<p>
“How?” the middle-aged financier asked. “They’re obviously very well-trained. And they have guns.”
</p>
<p>
“We won’t be unarmed,” Danny assured. “But I’m not talking about weapons. I’m talking about situational awareness. It’s close-quarters in there, and we’ve got a massive tactical advantage.”
</p>
<p>
Mike nodded his big furry head. “The cameras. You’re talking about going all Splinter Cell on them, right? Covert ops?”
</p>
<p>
“Right,” said Danny. “We can see everything going on in there. They can’t. And that information asymmetry means that <em>we</em> have the upper hand. At Claymore, I built Navy communication grids. I’ve got college buddies at companies like Palantir and MITRE, who are getting seriously rich right now building data-mining tools for the CIA and the Department of Homeland Security. Modern battlefields are digital. During both Iraq wars, what’s the first thing the US Army did? Knocked out the enemy computer networks. During the riots in Iran and Libya and Syria, the rulers disabled civilian access to cellphones. Information, you see, is what the military refers to as a ‘force multiplier’. Yes, those guys in there have the guns. But the information? That, gentlemen, is our game.”
</p>
<p>
“I want in,” said Mike. He hopped out of the car and went to stand by Danny.
</p>
<p>
“Do you have a plan, Danny?” asked Jason.
</p>
<p>
“Not yet,” he said. He reached down to retrieve his laptop from the asphalt. “First thing we need to do,” he said, “is find a way into the building…”
</p>
<p>
Satish said grudgingly, “I can get you in.”
</p>
<p>
“You can?” said Danny.
</p>
<p>
“Yeah,” Satish answered. He was still standing with his back against the Navigator, sulking. “I think you’re completely insane, but if you’ve decided to go get yourself killed then I guess I can help.” He fiddled for a minute with his laptop. “Here, Danny. Look at the outside camera. Zoom in on the keycard reader.”
</p>
<p>
Danny pulled up the feed on his laptop. As he watched, the green light popped on to indicate the door was unlocked. It stayed lit for several seconds.
</p>
<p>
“How’d you do that?” Danny said quickly.
</p>
<p>
“A replay attack,” said Satish. “When that guy opened the door, the keycard reader sent a UDP packet to an authentication database, which replied with a datagram to unlock the door. I saw the whole thing on my packet sniff. I just sent the keycard reader an exact copy of the authorization message.”
</p>
<p>
“Neat!” said Danny. “Thank you, Satish. Now all we need is a way to get that guy away from the front door. Let me think…”
</p>
<p>
He stood staring at the ground. His body remained frozen, but his eyes darted rapidly in spastic patterns; his lips writhed with soundless mumbling; his fingers twitched as though drawing diagrams in an ethereal notebook.
</p>
<p>
After a minute of fidgety silence, he looked up abruptly. “Jason. You’re part of this little Dungeons and Dragons group, right? How are your role-playing skills?”
</p>
<p>
“Uhh… pretty good, I guess…?” Jason said.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll need them. And we’ll need your car. Do you have anything we can use as a weapon? A flare gun, maybe? Or a lug wrench?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s a big metal tool for changing tires, right? Looks like a plus sign?” Jason asked. “It’s under the spare tire in the back.”
</p>
<p>
Danny turned his head to the SUV. “Mike, you said you play hockey, right? Think you can handle beating someone into submission with a metal stick?”
</p>
<p>
Mike grinned enthusiastically.
</p>
<p>
“Moshen,” said Danny. “Get out of the car. You and Satish will stay right here.” 
</p>
<p>
“What about you, Danny?” asked Jason.
</p>
<p>
“Me? I’ll be going in with <em>this</em>.” 
</p>
<p>
He opened the passenger door of the Navigator and grabbed his Claymore tote bag filled with metal and plastic parts. He began pulling them out one by one, starting with the piece that looked like a narrow homemade bullhorn, the hollow metal tube with the pistol grip and the large rubber-coated metal blocks on the back.
</p>
<p>
The men watched him as he drew more parts from the bag.
</p>
<p>
After the bullhorn came a row of plastic blocks, each as big as a Rubik’s Cube, joined into a line with duct tape. Next came a group of eight heavy blue cylinders, each one the size and shape of a tallboy beer can, arranged like an eight-pack and held together with duct tape and stiff wire. Each component was strung on thick black and red cables, the junction points buried under a slather of caulk and epoxy. 
</p>
<p>
A two-foot-long white hollow plastic tube, about four inches wide with slots and grooves all along its length, stuck out from the top of the bag. Danny grabbed it and began screwing it onto the back of the horn.
</p>
<p>
“The hell’s that thing?” asked Moshen.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Danny as he worked, “this part in front is a magnetron that I ‘borrowed’ from a battleship radar system at Naval Base Kitsap.” He took the eight-pack of heavy blue cylinders and secured it to the back of the white tube with a few loops of stiff wire. “<em>This</em> is a bank of high-voltage ultracapacitors. They were invented pretty recently, for running hybrid cars. They can pump out almost a megajoule per second. And <em>this</em>…” He Velcro’ed the plastic cubes along the length of the tube like the spine of some ancient reptilian creature. “…is a set of relays for switching between serial charge and parallel discharge…”
</p>
<p>
He pulled out a slotted metal box with air vents and a three-prong power socket. “This is the power conversion module,” Danny said as he attached it to the white tube with twisty-ties. “And finally, <em>this</em>…” He pulled out a stack of laptop batteries. “…is a stack of laptop batteries.” The stack was about a dozen batteries high, all duct-taped together with their metal contacts tethered to one another with coils of cable. Danny snapped it onto the PVC tube with several small karabiners. 
</p>
<p>
He stood up and held the device in both hands. Fully assembled, it was about four feet long. With the flick of a few switches, tiny lights lit up from inside the metal power box and near the capacitor bank. Small fans whirred to life inside the power supply box. The device emitted a faint high-pitched whine that rose until it passed above the range of human hearing.
</p>
<p>
He slung the end of the PVC tube, with its assortment of duct-taped and twisty-tied components, over his right shoulder. He held the pistol grip of the magnetron horn with his right hand, and let a giant smug grin consume his face.
</p>
<p>
The men gawked. “Seriously, Danny, what is that thing?” demanded Jason.
</p>
<p>
Danny replied coyly, “It’s just a… A flashlight.” 
</p>
<p>
“That’s one seriously elaborate flashlight,” said Jason.
</p>
<p>
“It’s very, very bright,” said Danny, and inhaled sharply through his nose. “So listen up, comrades. Here’s what’s going to happen…” 
</p>
