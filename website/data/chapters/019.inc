<span class="caplead">
The fabric upholstery pressed against</span> Danny’s naked back, leaving a grid of tiny square crosshatches in his skin. The rough polyester seatbelt cut awkwardly across his chest. His wounded shoulder throbbed painfully beneath its gauze dressing, and his hand still stung from being cut and burned. 
</p>
<p>
The two men had not exchanged a single word. Danny stared wordlessly out the open window. He breathed the fresh night air deeply &mdash; he couldn’t stand his own stench of chemicals, sweat, and blood.
</p>
<p>
The trip was not silent, however. The middle-aged financier spent the time on his cellphone, speaking frantically into his Bluetooth headset. The conversations were brief and cheerful. They went along the lines of, “Hello, Mr. Cartwright…” “Ms. Yonath…” “Mr. Chew…” “Yes, everything’s just fine! Listen, I’m afraid I won’t be able to provide you with a sample after all… Yes, unfortunately the prototype is inaccessible. But … Yes, we’re absolutely still on…” 
</p>
<p>
Those were the ones that Danny could understand. The rest were in fluent German, French, and Mandarin.
</p>
<p>
Eventually, the conversations ended. The silence was even less palatable than the chatter. 
</p>
<p>
Jason finally said something. “So, I’m dropping you off at your house, I guess?”
</p>
<p>
“Yeah.”
</p>
<p>
To the right, the long straight streets of the city passed by them, the red brick tenements of the waterfront rolling by quickly as the tall forms of art deco skyscrapers drifted slowly in the background. To the left, the quiet waters of Elliott Bay sparkled silver in the starlight, rimmed by the low black silhouette of Alki Beach on the opposite shore, beneath the Olympic Mountains somewhere far beyond.
</p>
<p>
Danny looked at the clock above the car’s radio, counting the minutes until he would get home. “Who are you talking to, anyway?” he asked. “It’s two o’clock in the morning.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s five p.m. in Singapore.”
</p>
<p>
They drove on, the air in the car thick with the lingering smell of nail polish remover and jet fuel.
</p>
<p>
“We still don’t know who owns Tungsten,” Jason said.
</p>
<p>
“Excuse me?” Danny replied.
</p>
<p>
“The consortium,” said Jason. “The overseas consortium who bought the company when it was about to go bankrupt. The ones who installed Dr. Passinsky. We still don’t know anything about them.”
</p>
<p>
“So what?” Danny dismissed.
</p>
<p>
“We should find out,” Jason said, trying to sound nonchalant.
</p>
<p>
Danny shrank in his seat. “I don’t think so.”
</p>
<p>
 After a pause, Jason said, “I’ve kind of got some deals in the works. That little bit of info would really help.”
</p>
<p>
Danny continued staring wordlessly out the window.
</p>
<p>
“We should at least make sure that Tungsten has proper FDA licenses to work with scheduled substances,” Jason pressed. “I infer that they do, but I’d like to make certain before I include it in my final evaluation report.”
</p>
<p>
“Yeah, good luck with that,” Danny said sardonically. “I’m sure the teacher will love it. I hope you get an A.”
</p>
<p>
“Heh, I’m hoping for a little more than an A,” said Jason whimsically.
</p>
<p>
“Like what?”
</p>
<p>
“Like total control of the company,” Jason said simply.
</p>
<p>
Danny said nothing, but permitted himself to look at Jason just long enough to betray his curiosity.
</p>
<p>
“I spent twenty years as Tungsten’s COO,” said Jason. “I was your age when I took that position. Your age. Think about it. Before that, I was their Senior Vice President of Operations. And before <em>that</em>, I was the head of their Accounts Payable. I spent my whole life at that company. I took a sales position with them right out of college. They paid for my MBA. Thirty-five years, Danny. I’ve been with them for thirty-five years. You’re upset about the six years you sank into Claymore Communications, right? Well, that’s a blink of an eye. I was with Tungsten for as long as you’ve been alive. That company outlasted my marriage, Danny. I’ve known that company for longer than I’ve known my ex-wife. Longer than my children.”
</p>
<p>
“Yeah, and now you’re bitter that they canned you,” Danny concluded. “And you just want to stick it to them by stealing their core project.”
</p>
<p>
Jason shook his head and smiled sadly. “That’s not it at all, Danny. I hold no grudge against them. Firing me was the right move.”
</p>
<p>
Danny stared at him questioningly.
</p>
<p>
“Look, Tungsten had been an internationally successful reseller of high-end medical equipment since the seventies, right?” said Jason. “Its core business model was <em>sales</em>. Sales in the seventies and eighties. It was a different world back then, Danny. A world of business cards and Rolodexes and fax machines. A world of power ties and shoulder pads and expense lunches and bookings at Radisson Inns all over the country. Tungsten’s lifeblood was mail-order catalogs, cold-calls, and conference presentations. All the stuff that used to make business, business.
</p>
<p>
“And then, while I was COO, the Internet came. First email, then chat rooms, then the World Wide Web, then search engines and eBay and PayPal and AdSense… and then it was game over. I watched Tungsten waste away and die under my watch. I was helpless to stop it. Look, I’m all about adapting to the times and sailing with the winds of change and all that corporate boardroom jazz. I was happy to learn about all this new ‘Information Age’ stuff, to see if I could help fit it into Tungsten’s business model. And I did learn a lot about digital technology, enough to know my way around the dot-com world as an investor and venture capitalist. But as for Tungsten, there was nothing I could do to keep it afloat. Not as COO. I managed its operations, and it withered and died in my arms. The world moves fast, Danny. You know that as well as anyone does.”
</p>
<p>
Danny began to relax. “So you’re not in it for revenge. And you keep talking about your severance package and your dot-com investment stuff, so I assume you’re not in it for the money. So what are you doing all this for?”
</p>
<p>
“Redemption.”
</p>
<p>
Danny said nothing.
</p>
<p>
“My marriage fell apart, Danny. My kids hate me now. I haven’t talked to my ex-wife in years. And through the divorce and everything, it was all okay because… I mean, it wasn’t <em>okay</em>, obviously, but… at least I always had my work. I always had Tungsten. And I watched Tungsten collapse out from under me. I spent my lifetime building it, and it died on my watch. And now I need to find a way to make it be thrive. To prove to the world that I can make something work after all &mdash; especially something I’ve poured my whole life into. I need to prove that I can do <em>something</em> that doesn’t end in disaster and disappointment. That I’m not…”
</p>
<p>
“…A total failure?” Danny suggested, partly out of anger, partly out of a distinct sense of empathy.
</p>
<p>
Jason sighed, and slowly said, “Exactly.”
</p>
<p>
“How does stealing their intellectual property help anything?”
</p>
<p>
“It all has to do with a little problem with Tungsten’s paperwork,” said Jason, “that presents me with an interesting opportunity.”
</p>
<p>
“What kind of problem?”
</p>
<p>
“Danny, I was always totally honest when it came to Tungsten’s accounts,” said Jason. “I swear to that. I never cooked the books. I never performed or aided any insider trading. I never did anything to compromise myself or the company. But… near the end there, with Tungsten circling the drain, I’ll admit I did make a few moves that, um, could be considered controversial. I never lied, but I wasn’t always exactly forthcoming with the truth…”
</p>
<p>
“Go on,” Danny coaxed.
</p>
<p>
“Tungsten never formally declared bankruptcy. But most of our creditors believed we had, and, well… I never corrected them. So, they wrote off their investments in Tungsten as capital losses. But we never actually filed Chapter 11. When the creditors wrote off those losses in their year-end tax filings, we treated that as <em>ipso facto</em> forgiveness of the debt, and cleared the balances from our ledgers. But both the write-offs and the debt forgiveness were based on misunderstandings &mdash; arguably <em>willful</em> misunderstandings &mdash; and neither would hold up in a court of law.”
</p>
<p>
“So, what you mean is…” said Danny.
</p>
<p>
“What I mean,” explained Jason, “is that Tungsten is carrying almost a hundred million dollars in unsettled debt, with compounding interest. When this Eastern European consortium bought that company, they unknowingly bought a bottomless money pit.”
</p>
<p>
“So, then, who are all these people you’re calling now?”
</p>
<p>
“They’re some of our old creditors,” said Jason. “I’ve been in contact with them. Several weeks ago, I casually informed them about Tungsten’s lack of legally filed bankruptcy paperwork. They found the news very troubling.”
</p>
<p>
Danny merely shook his head with incredulity.
</p>
<p>
“Tungsten’s assets are rightly theirs, you see,” Jason clarified. “The creditors are still entitled to come and collect. They can legally force Tungsten to sell off everything it owns and divvy up the money among them. And that’s what they were ready to do when I first told them about Tungsten’s little paperwork snafu. Their natural reflex is to put everything on the auction block and recoup whatever they can, right?”
</p>
<p>
Danny chuckled bitterly. “Like what you just did to <em>my</em> company, Claymore Communications. I’m seeing a pattern here. As above, so below?” 
</p>
<p>
“It’s all just business,” Jason replied. “But with Tungsten there’s more to it now. See, an auction of Tungsten’s assets would barely net a few million dollars at most. Tungsten’s lenders thought most of the company’s capital was tied up in the stockroom where they keep all the inventory, and the stuff in there is obsolete and getting progressively more worthless every day. But Tungsten’s not a medical supply house anymore. It’s a biotechnology research firm now. And thanks to this nameless Eastern European consortium, Tungsten now has something that could be worth serious money.”
</p>
<p>
“So this whole mission tonight,” Danny followed, “was to provide proof that Tungsten is worth keeping. That it shouldn’t be disbanded, but kept around in its new form.”
</p>
<p>
“Exactly,” said Jason. “This consortium, whoever they are, was kind enough to find a way to do what I couldn’t: turn Tungsten around. Give it potential. Give it life. Give it relevance.”
</p>
<p>
“Uh-huh. And you’re going to reward them for their efforts by getting Tungsten’s old investors to swoop in and take it back from them.” 
</p>
<p>
Jason shrugged. “It is what it is,” he said distantly.
</p>
<p>
“And what’s in it for you?” Danny asked pointedly.
</p>
<p>
“The new investment group I’ve set up consists solely of international creditors,” said Jason. “I’ve made a deal with them. See, they’re going to need a new President and CEO. Someone local. Someone who’s been in the business his whole life. Someone who knows American corporate practices and who has experience running a company like this.”
</p>
<p>
“Right,” Danny said with a snort. “And, naturally, who better to take the reins than someone who not only has experience running a company <em>like</em> this, but actually running <em>this</em> company…”
</p>
<p>
“Exactly!” said Jason. 
</p>
<p>
“…into the ground,” Danny finished.
</p>
<p>
A glare of anger flashed momentarily across Jason’s face. He looked at Danny with furious eyes, and opened his mouth to say something. But in a blink, the middle-aged man pushed the rage away, and turned to gaze emptily at the road ahead. He nodded humbly, and squared his jaw as his face hardened into an expression of distant determination. “Yeah. I did,” he said, his voice low. “But not this time. Not this time.” 
</p>
</div>

<div class="chapsection">
<p>
<span class="caplead">The sight of his flat little house</span> made Danny giddy with relief. The red pickup truck worked its way, Pac Man-like, through the grid of streets in the University District, until it finally came to park on the curb outside Danny’s front yard. The one-story structure, with its blue siding and brown roof and white door and attached two-car garage, had never looked so inviting. In his mind, Danny was already heading to his bedroom.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll send your payment by PayPal tomorrow,” Jason said with a tired voice.
</p>
<p>
Danny collected his HERF gun, carefully examining the power cables from which the magnetron dangled. “My payment?” he said absentmindedly. 
</p>
<p>
“For your services tonight,” Jason said. “You’ve sure as hell earned it.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh. Right,” he replied, taking off his seatbelt. “Yes, thanks.”
</p>
<p>
“So, I’ll call you tomorrow to discuss the consortium?” Jason asked.
</p>
<p>
Danny froze with his hand on the door handle. “Uh… what’s there to discuss?”
</p>
<p>
“I really would like to find out who they are,” said Jason. “I’ll pay you for the additional labor, of course.”
</p>
<p>
Danny slumped back into his seat with an intense frown, avoiding eye contact. “I… I don’t think so, Jason.”
</p>
<p>
“Why not?” Jason asked innocently.
</p>
<p>
Danny’s shoulders hunched and his head lowered in a subconscious effort to hide, his body obeying some kind of ancient reptilian instinct to retract his head and flippers inside his shell. “I don’t want to do this anymore, alright?”
</p>
<p>
Jason’s eyes narrowed. “Danny, just what the hell are you so upset about?”
</p>
<p>
Danny asked morosely, “Why did you hire me?”
</p>
<p>
Jason hesitated for a few seconds. “What do you mean? To get inside information on Tungsten, obviously.”
</p>
<p>
Danny shook his head. “That’s not what I mean. Why did you hire <em>me</em>?”
</p>
<p>
Jason simply stared at him.
</p>
<p>
“I’m not a hacker, Jason,” Danny insisted. “I’m an engineer. I’m a builder, not a breaker. All this cloak-and-dagger confrontation bullshit isn’t what I do. <em>This</em> is what I do…” He held up his HERF gun. “<em>This</em> is what I do…” He held up his cellphone. “You’re getting the picture, right? I don’t do <em>this</em>…” He fished Eugene’s hacked Pantech out of his pocket. “…And I sure as shit don’t do <em>this</em>…” He turned his shoulder to display the gauze dressing over his bullet wound. “You knew from the very beginning that you needed a hacker. Not an engineer, but specifically a hacker. And yet you hired me anyway.”
</p>
<p>
“I needed someone smart who could do the job,” Jason countered. 
</p>
<p>
“And you thought <em>I</em> was the right guy for it?” Danny fired back. “Bullshit. This is Seattle, Jason. There’s dozens of top-notch hacker outfits you could’ve hired, both legal and illegal. IOActive. Leviathan Security. The Ghetto Hackers. The Schmoo Group. Some of the shadier members of Agora. There’s literally a thousand people in this city that would’ve done a better job at this than me, for a lower price.”
</p>
<p>
“Danny, I don’t have any inroads to folks like that,” Jason defended. “It’s not like I can just type ‘Seattle hackers’ into Google and get contact information for…”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, you can,” Danny interrupted.
</p>
<p>
“Right. And I’m supposed to just work with some random guy off the Internet who happens to be a semi-professional criminal?”
</p>
<p>
Danny glared at him. “For a <em>criminal</em> activity? Yes, Jason! That’s <em>exactly</em> what you’re supposed to do!”
</p>
<p>
Jason shook his head. “Look, I needed someone I could trust, alright? Someone who I knew would be on my side. Someone who…”
</p>
<p>
Danny cut him off accusatorially. “Someone who would do this job because he had nowhere else to turn, right? Because you just got done taking the company he’s poured his blood, sweat, and tears into for the last six years and decided to make it go Poof! No more! All gone! ‘So what are you going to do now?’ Right? ‘Oh, well, gosh, Danny, I’ve coincidentally got this little side-project…’”
</p>
<p>
“Danny, you make it sound like I’d had some kind of grand master plan this whole time,” Jason said defensively. “It wasn’t like that. At all. It was more… More, um…”
</p>
<p>
“Opportunistic?” Danny offered bitterly.
</p>
<p>
Jason looked away, saying nothing.
</p>
<p>
“It wasn’t so much a diabolical mastermind plot as it was seizing an opening, wasn’t it?” Danny said. “You knew that hacking Tungsten would help you in this little hostile takeover quest of yours, if only you could find someone to do it for you. And you knew that I’d be lost and desperate once you and your fellow investor buddies got done shredding Claymore. And there you were &mdash; you found yourself with a square peg in one hand and a round hole in the other…”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Danny! Business is opportunistic! Good fucking morning,” Jason fired back. “But you know what? You <em>were</em> the opportunity. And you still are. I hired you <em>because</em> I could use you. Because I believed you could get the job done. What exactly is so wrong with that? You’re a man who takes pride in his work, right? Well, look at the work you’ve done tonight, Danny! You faced challenges beyond anything I’d foreseen, and you persevered in ways I never would have expected. You have nothing to feel right now but pride.”
</p>
<p>
“Pride? <em>Pride?</em>” Danny repeated shrilly. “You think I should feel <em>pride?</em> Jason, all I feel right now is regret! Regret for meeting you, regret for agreeing to any of this, regret for being in this car right now. I never want to do anything like this <em>ever again</em>. I wish I didn’t do it at all in the first place. I wish I could erase the memories of it that are playing in an infinite loop in my head right now &mdash; all these… these horrific scenes of… of… Fuck! I wish I could rewind back to yesterday afternoon, when you came up to me after my Claymore presentation, and just told you, ‘No, thanks.’ And in some alternate universe, in which I actually did that like I should’ve, I’ve spent all night tonight updating my LinkedIn profile and fiddling with my resume and flipping through job openings on Craigslist, and right now I’d be staying up late re-playing Skyrim because I know I don’t have work tomorrow. <em>That’s</em> where I’m supposed to be. <em>That’s</em> my life. <em>That’s</em> my home universe. But instead, I’m <em>here</em>. And <em>here</em>, I’ve spent the night… in…”
</p>
<p>
He looked down at himself, at his shirtless torso and his wounded hand. He felt his shoulder throbbing. He took a long, slow, deep breath. 
</p>
<p>
“I’m sorry, Jason.” He popped the car door open. “You want to continue this insanity and go digging up dirt on this consortium or whatever? You’ll have to do it without me. Find some other pet cybermonkey to sick on your business rivals. I’m done.”
</p>
</div>

<div class="chapsection">
<p>
<span class="caplead">Beeping sounds chirped outside </span>Danny’s front door as he punched in his keycode. The digital lock pinged and the deadbolt slid away under the pull of an electromagnetic solenoid. In the dark, the door’s insulation foam swished softly against the stone tiles in the entryway. Tired hiking-booted feet dragged themselves inside. Motion sensors detected a human-sized infrared blob, and the main room’s lights gently came to life to welcome Danny’s return.
</p>
<p>
Danny’s home was spacious but simple. His foyer, kitchen, and living room formed one continuous L-shaped expanse which wrapped around his bedroom and bathroom. Ahead of him, the large kitchen was demarked by a granite-topped peninsula counter. To his side, the living room contained his black leather sofa, his carefully arranged surround-sound speakers, and an enormous entertainment system built to house a large LED TV and countless different kinds of gaming consoles both modern and vintage. A myriad of remotes and game controllers lay scattered on the coffee table, beside a metal arcade-style <em>Dance Dance Revolution</em> mat that lay nestled in the gray carpet. Soft spiraling tracks around the furniture marked the latest trip by the Roomba that sat resting in its recharging station.
</p>
<p>
Danny’s first destination was through another door in the foyer, which led to his attached garage. Half of the space inside was dedicated to his Toyota Prius and his washer and dryer. The other half Danny had built into a digital electronics workshop. A solder-stained workbench formed the heart of his home laboratory, ringed by an oscilloscope, a logic analyzer, a naked computer with attached EEPROM burner, a box of Arduino boards, a whiteboard covered with equations and diagrams, and a wall full of small Plexiglas drawers holding assorted breadboard components. 
</p>
<p>
He laid the HERF gun on his workbench and loosened the wires that he had severed during the fight in the factory. He prepared some shrink-wrap insulation for the red and black cables respectively, and heated up a soldering iron. With his hand still smarting from its injuries, with his torso still naked except for the gauze wrapping on his shoulder, with his brain still reeling from the fumes and the blood loss and the exhaustion, he nonetheless tended carefully to the beloved patient on his workbench. The surgery only took a minute. A few gentle dabs of solder, a few hoarse blasts from a heat gun to seal the insulation, and the high-voltage device was restored to operational status. 
</p>
<p>
Before going back into the house, Danny found a spare power cable and plugged the HERF gun into the wall. The lights in the garage dimmed. He left the device to feed for the night.
</p>
<p>
He shuffled zombie-like to the bathroom, determined to cleanse himself of the stink of jet fuel and nail polish remover and soot and sweat and blood. His shower was very long and very hot. The trials and horrors of the day dissolved away down the drain, and he stepped out of the shower clean and new and freshly baptized. He found his home first-aid kit and clumsily reapplied his shoulder dressing with the help of the bathroom mirrors, and treated his hand with bandages and salve. He dressed himself in blue linen pajamas, turned off the lights, and stumbled to his bedroom.
</p>
<p>
He let himself fall face-first onto his bed, closed his eyes, and wrapped his blankets around his body.
</p>
<p>
The doorbell rang.
</p>
