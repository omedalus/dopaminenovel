<p>
<span class="caplead">Inside the ultra low freezer</span> were half a dozen rack shelves. On each shelf were half a dozen long, deep boxes made of metal and Styrofoam, built to slide out like drawers. Inside each box were two dozen vials, each no bigger than a finger. And one of these vials was the one that the man with the gun was looking for.
</p>
<p>
“I n-need you b-be more s-piffic,” Tina said through a shivering jaw as she closed the massive metal door yet again.
</p>
<p>
The man sat on a desk between her and the exit. “I already told you. It’s a small clear plastic snap-top tube with a cone-shaped bottom.” He kept his revolver pointed at her absentmindedly, his attention divided between her and his cellphone.
</p>
<p>
“You just described <em>every</em> vial in there,” she said as she peeled off the thick black acrylic gloves that protected her fingers from frostbite.
</p>
<p>
Ignoring her, the man tapped his Bluetooth headset and fiddled with his cellphone. “<em>Allyo? Allyo, Leonya? Gdye ti, durak?</em>”
</p>
<p>
“Is everything okay?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“My partner isn’t answering,” he said. Catching himself, he added, “But this is not your business. Where is that fucking tube?”
</p>
<p>
“I have no idea,” Tina said. “Look, there’s hundreds of vials in deep-freeze. They all look exactly the same. I have no clue how the lab staff keeps track of which one goes where. How did you expect to know which vial’s the right one, anyway?”
</p>
<p>
While still poking at his phone, he replied, “There is a smiley face on the side.”
</p>
<p>
“The only way I can find that is by checking each vial one by one,” Tina said weakly.
</p>
<p>
The man rolled his eyes. “Just start dumping boxes out onto the floor.”
</p>
<p>
“You can’t do that,” she said. “The brown goo in the vials is bacteria frozen in glycerol. They’re living things. They can’t live in the suspension. The glycerol protects them from ice when they get frozen, but they need water and food. If they come out of suspended animation in the glycerol, they might die.”
</p>
<p>
The man nodded. “That would be very bad. See, I knew you would be useful!”
</p>
<p>
“No. I’m not. I really can’t help you. I’m sorry,” she insisted. “Please. I don’t know what’s in this vial that’s so special to you. I’m just the receptionist, okay? Tungsten does <em>not</em> pay me enough for this. How about I just walk out of here, I’ll get my purse from the front, I’ll drive away, go home, and we’ll both say none of this ever happened? I’m not going to call the cops, I’m not going to remember your face, I’m not going to have any idea about you or Julie or about anything. Okay? Please, I swear to God, I want nothing to do with this.” 
</p>
<p>
“I have better idea,” he said dismissively. “How about you shut the hell up and get back to looking for that tube?”
</p>
<p>
Tina looked at the cryogenic storage unit and winced.
</p>
<p>
The freezer was attached to a monitoring terminal, a small ancient dirty beige computer with a ridiculous thick clunky keyboard. The terminal kept track of the environment inside the freezer. “<span class="computer">TEMPERATURE: 200.7K -72.4oC -98.3oF</span>”, its screen reported in blocky green letters.
</p>
<p>
“Can I at least borrow your jacket?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“My jacket? Lady, this is Italian custom-made lambskin leather.”
</p>
<p>
“So that’s a no, then?” Tina glanced back and forth from the freezer to the terminal. Her body began preemptively shivering as she pulled the gloves back onto her hands. A yank of the handle released the cryogenic storage unit’s seal, and she again found herself standing in a pale cloud of stabbing cold mist. The freezer’s loud pumps whirred with effort to keep the interior frigid in spite of the open door. The monitoring terminal’s temperature readout fluctuated by a few tenths of a degree. Tina quickly reached for a case of vials and began pulling it from its rack shelf as quickly as her shaking hands would allow.
</p>
<p>
 From the corner of her eye, she noticed a change on the terminal screen. Beneath the temperature readout, the monitor now displayed, “<span class="computer">GREELEY, JAMES N</span>”. It was the name of one of the geneticists.
</p>
<p>
With a hopeful gasp, she slid the box back into its position on the rack. On the screen, the name disappeared.
</p>
<p>
She tentatively pulled another box halfway out. On the monitoring terminal, green blocky text said, “<span class="computer">LEVIN, SHANA</span>”. Another one of the researchers.
</p>
<p>
Tina pushed the box back into place and let out a whimper of relief.
</p>
<p>
“What the hell are you doing?” the man grunted. “Wasting time?”
</p>
<p>
“The boxes are labeled electronically!” Tina said as she pulled out more cases one at a time. “They’re organized by staff assignment!” She worked her way systematically across the rows, keeping her eyes on the monitoring terminal as names appeared and disappeared on the screen. There seemed to be no order dictating which boxes were assigned to which researchers &mdash; many researchers had multiple boxes, spread seemingly at random inside the storage unit. But after a minute of perseverance, gritting her teeth against the cold, Tina finally pulled a case that caused the monitor to display, “<span class="computer">YEN, JULIE</span>”.
</p>
<p>
Tina wasted no time in taking the box out of the freezer. She set it down on a nearby desk and slammed the freezer shut to keep the painfully frigid air from spilling out. She popped the lid open and looked at the vials inside.
</p>
<p>
One of the vials had visibly less frost on its cap than the others. It had clearly been withdrawn from the box much more frequently than the rest.
</p>
<p>
Tina carefully drew the tube out of its slot. It was less than two inches long with a conical bottom, filled with a pale brown substance that looked frozen solid. It bore no label, but a small smiley face was drawn with a black felt-tip pen on its translucent round surface. She let out a long, shaky, cathartic sigh.
</p>
<p>
The Russian perked up as he saw her place the tube down on the desk and pull off the thermal gloves.
</p>
<p>
“Here. Take it,” she said, backing away from the desk.
</p>
<p>
The Russian eagerly stepped forward. He slid his cellphone into his jacket pocket and picked up the tube with the tips of his fingers. His leather gloves gave him partial protection from the vial’s necrotizing temperature.
</p>
<p>
“Are we done here?” Tina asked.
</p>
<p>
The man grinned and held the vial up in front of his face, examining it with delight. “Yes. I think we are.”
</p>
<p>
“Good,” she said. “Goodbye.” She circled around the far side of the desk and made a bee-line for the door. She knew she was leaving the box of Julie’s intern projects unrefrigerated on the desk. Those <em>E. coli</em> strains would thaw and they’d all be dead by morning. Oh well.
</p>
<p>
She didn’t make it to the door. A cold leather-gloved hand clamped firmly around her wrist and jerked her back. 
</p>
<p>
“No!” she shouted.
</p>
<p>
“Not so fast, young lady.” He held her wrist with his left hand. Both the gun and the tube were in his right.
</p>
<p>
“What!” she protested. “What do you want! Let me go!”
</p>
<p>
“You’re really quite useful, you know,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“You said we’re done here!” She tried to pull her wrist back. He wouldn’t release her.
</p>
<p>
“We are done <em>here</em>,” repeated the man. “But… I have more use for you...”
</p>
<p>
Tina felt her stomach lurch. “Fuck you, <em>no</em>!” she screamed, and fought against his grip with all her might. But he was far too strong. 
</p>
<p>
He yanked her back into the room with a forceful pull and released her, letting her momentum carry her a few stumbling steps away from him. He once again stood between her and the door. He didn’t bother pointing the gun at her. 
</p>
<p>
“Relax,” he said in a commanding tone. “Do not assume things. I’ve done this before &mdash; I know what you are worrying about. But lady, I am a professional. I don’t mix business with pleasure. Besides, I get hotter pieces of ass than you any time I want. Your body is of no interest to me.”
</p>
<p>
Tina stared at him silently. She felt both slightly relieved and incredibly insulted at the same time.
</p>
<p>
“You are proving handy to have around,” he said. “Besides…” He gestured with the vial. “I need to make sure you did not pull any funny business with this tube. I need the stuff in here to come out alive. And you seem to know how to make that happen.”
</p>
<p>
Tina gulped quietly.
</p>
<p>
“So, here is a plan,” he continued. “We take you back to our factory. Your little friend is there &mdash; she will be happy to see you. We will keep you until we finish a good batch and see that everything works. It should only take a few days. You will be treated well. Nobody will hurt you. And when you get success, we will let you go.”
</p>
<p>
“You have got to be kidding me,” Tina said.
</p>
<p>
“Stop arguing already! Cooperate and things will go well for you. We are businessmen, not animals. Besides, my boss feels particular kindness toward young women. Now come on!” He waved the gun at her. “This is happening. Let’s go before this tube gets any warmer.”
</p>
<p>
Tina stood frozen in place. She could feel her pulse in her neck.
</p>
<p>
“Get moving! Go go go!” he ordered.
</p>
<p>
The sound of his voice began to recede, like she was hearing it underwater. She felt her skin crawl as goosebumps rose. Her blood ran cold. Her mind began to race. She looked around the room.
</p>
<p>
A few feet away from her was the old dirty beige freezer monitoring terminal with the green screen and the big heavy keyboard.
</p>
<p>
“Okay. I’ll do it,” she said, her own voice sounding oddly distant and flat. 
</p>
<p>
“Good girl,” he said. “Now let’s go already.”
</p>
<p>
“I need to check the environmental settings for the cold storage unit here,” she said, nodding her head toward the terminal. “When we get the tube back to your factory, I’ll need to store it somewhere with the exact same temperature, pressure, and humidity levels.”
</p>
<p>
He grinned again. “See! You’re being useful already!”
</p>
<p>
She made a few useless, meaningless keystrokes. The large, clunky keys of the ancient keyboard made loud ka-chunk! sounds beneath her fingers.
</p>
<p>
“My colleagues and I will show our appreciation of you being so helpful,” the man said to her. “If you continue to be so diligent, you will be rewarded.”
</p>
<p>
She squinted at the screen and leaned her face very close to the monitor. “Damn it,” she said slowly.
</p>
<p>
“Is everything alright?” he asked her.
</p>
<p>
“This isn’t making any sense,” she said. “Come here, can you take a look at this?”
</p>
<p>
He stepped toward the terminal and stood right behind her.
</p>
<p>
She glanced over her shoulder. He was still holding both the vial and the revolver in the same hand. That meant his grip on both was probably weak.
</p>
<p>
She put her hands on either side of the keyboard and leaned her head to the left, encouraging him to look over her right shoulder. She curled her fingers underneath the keyboard’s edges.
</p>
<p>
“See where it says ‘Temperature’?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“Yes…” he said, leaning his face forward toward the screen.
</p>
<p>
In a swift upward jerking motion of both arms over her right shoulder, Tina smashed the keyboard against his face.
</p>
<p>
She let go of the keyboard, which fell away with a clatter, and reached for his hand. Her palm made contact with the butt of the revolver. She grabbed it and pushed the barrel upward and away from her. She worked her fingers in between his hand and the gun. 
</p>
<p>
The vial fell out of his hand. She could hear it rolling in a small circle on the linoleum.
</p>
<p>
The revolver twisted in his grasp but wouldn’t yield. Her index finger landed inside the trigger guard.
</p>
<p>
She realized that, even if she couldn’t take the gun from him, she could at least empty it. Guns only hold so many bullets. And without the threat of being shot, she might be able to make a run for it. She pulled the trigger.
</p>
<p>
The sound was not just deafening. It was so loud it was blinding.
</p>
<p>
Tina felt a hot shock wave blast across her face and jostle her hair. Her nostrils filled with the sharp, earthy odor of gunpowder. For a nearly imperceptible moment her vision registered a foot-long arc of black and orange flame erupt from the barrel. It was beyond all her imagination and intuition that something so small could unleash such incredible power.
</p>
<p>
The revolver kicked outward and upward. The man’s arm, retaining the gun, flew back and up above his shoulder, pulling away from Tina’s grasp.
</p>
<p>
Grainy white dust sprinkled from the wall that the gun had been pointed at. There was a hole in the drywall, near the ceiling. It was the size of a man’s fist.
</p>
<p>
For a split second, she was too disoriented to move. The shock of the explosion left her paralyzed with bewilderment, seeing nothing but the hole in the wall and hearing nothing but the ringing in her own ears. On an instinctive level, she felt like she had to make sure she could at least still breathe before doing anything else.
</p>
<p>
And suddenly she couldn’t.
</p>
<p>
The Russian turned the gun in his hand so that the butt pointed out. With Tina’s back pressed up against him, he sharply bent his arm inward. The butt of the gun hit Tina high in her abdomen, just below her sternum.
</p>
<p>
She grabbed her chest with both hands, clutching the point of impact in incredible pain. She gasped desperately for air, writhing and twisting her body, trying hopelessly to get her breathing to work again. Her lungs would no longer expand and contract, leaving stale air sitting in her helpless alveoli. She heaved her shoulders up and down to get a shallow current of oxygen into her quickly acidifying bloodstream. Her clenching throat emitted an unnatural, high-pitched wheezing sound with every inhale.
</p>
<p>
After several terrifying seconds, she felt her breath gradually return.
</p>
<p>
“Stupid fucking bitch,” grumbled the Russian, angry but collected. He touched two gloved fingers of his left hand to his mouth and examined them. His lower lip was bleeding where Tina had busted it open with the keyboard. “You fucking loser whore. Why do you fight me? Hah? Tell me!” He knelt down and retrieved the vial from the floor. “You said yourself five minutes ago, this company doesn’t pay you enough for this. You like your stupid minimum-wage secretary job? You like being front desk girl? I give you a chance to do something interesting. Much more exciting work, much more respect and using much more of your smarts, maybe even making some money if everything worked out. And you repay me how? Smacking my face with fucking computer keyboard? Fucking bitch. I told you, you cooperate, things go good for you. This? This is not cooperate! I was going to be a nice guy for you. Now I have to be a bad guy again. So now you get snubnose forty-four Magnum pointed in your face. Feel good? No. So get your stupid ass moving while our little tube here is still nice and cold and happy. No more wasting time. You waste more time, I hurt you in ways that take longer to heal. Understand?”
</p>
<p>
Tina’s mind spun with anger, fear, and self-pity. Under the command of the man with the gun, with nausea welling up in her throat, she began to march toward the door.
</p>
<p>
It was then that the Russian, with a startled expression, suddenly turned his head toward the hallway. He quickly and quietly motioned with his hand for her to stop moving.
</p>
<p>
Tina halted in her tracks. “What now?” she demanded.
</p>
<p>
“Shhhhh!” said the Russian.
</p>
<p>
Tina could just barely make out a man’s voice from far down the hallway. Both Tina and the Russian stood frozen. The man’s voice drew closer.
</p>
<p>
“Negative, Dispatch,” said the man’s voice. “No signs of engagement. Breach signals are rising. Proceeding further into Sector G.”
</p>
<p>
The Russian stared at the doorway with a look of fear and disgust. “What the fuck is this shit?” he mumbled slowly.
</p>
<p>
“Dispatch, I’m seeing illumination from the cryogenic storage facility room area,” the unseen man said loudly. “Radiometric breach waves are continuing to increase. Yes, that’s correct. I’ll head toward the cryogenic area. Approaching now.”
</p>
<p>
The Russian turned to Tina with eyes wide, his expression angrily demanding answers. Tina, just as confused, shrugged with upturned palms.
</p>
<p>
The Russian closed his fist around the tube in his left hand, hiding it in his black leather glove. He tucked his revolver into his jacket pocket. “Don’t move,” he said to her.
</p>
<p>
He then stepped out into the hallway, and as he closed the door, he said, “Who the fuck are you?”
</p>
<p>
