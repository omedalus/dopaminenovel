Hayes scratched at his arm and realized he was shivering again. His nerves jangled with the needling tension that always took him at this hour.
Cho Lun's Carpentry was only a block away but here in this loud, chattering chaos it seemed miles. He picked up his pace and skipped through a gap
in the groups of people. As he did someone shouted, "Princeling! Hey, Princeling! Princeling's here!" but he did not respond.
</p>
<p>
He reached into his pocket to touch his savings. It was more of a wad of small bills, kept together by his sweat. He wondered how much time that would buy him. An hour. Maybe less. When he had first started coming to the dens he had bought
out booths for the entire night, sprawled out on the cushions and teasing the girls for favors. Now it was utilitarian. Medicinal. He came to get his 
regular dose, and then he could make it through the next day.
</p>

<p>
He counted his cash again. It wasn't enough. Not for what he needed.
</p>
<p>
Hayes scanned the crowd and wandered for a bit before he found what he was looking for. In front of a closed warehouse a group of youths had set up a table game, the usual find-the-jack switch.
They weren't working in shifts, which was lucky. Just one frontman and the rest of the gang organizing. It would be far easier to get a bead on things that way.

<p>
Hayes took up a station just down the alley from them and leaned up against the brick wall and waited. He listened to the leader's chatter, to his cajoling and wheedling.
Watched the movements of his hands and the blur of the cards.
</p>
<p>
Then he took a breath, let it out, tried to pay attention.
</p>
<p>
It took about an hour for Hayes to start getting it. It helped that all the boys were watching the game at once. Soon the sensations started leaking in, the joy of the con and the careful attention of the bait and hook.
Let them win a little, let them lose more. The greed burned inside Hayes and he began to hold the pattern in his mind, the way one thought and feeling segued into another, the way the
night was supposed to work for these young men.
It was faint and not much to work with, but Hayes didn't have much time.
