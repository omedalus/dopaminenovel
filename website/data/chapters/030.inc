<span class="caplead">With the watchful eyes of his team</span> and a few well-timed HERF pulses, Danny managed to stay out of sight of the police combing the Gallante. There were a few close calls, but he slipped out of the building unnoticed. 
</p>
<p>
The battery in his cellphone gave out after he left the hotel. In silence and moonlit darkness, Danny cut through the evergreen-fringed backyards of Medina billionaires. He looked out for security cameras and motion-detecting floodlights, zapping them when necessary. After slow, tentative progress across private property, he felt he had put a comfortable distance between himself and the hotel. He climbed over a retaining wall and arrived at a wide, well-lit road running through downtown Bellevue. There, he pulled off his overalls, leaving himself in a t-shirt and jeans. He stuffed his electrician disguise down a gutter grate. 
</p>
<p>
Then he figured out which direction led toward the Kirkland Marina, slung his HERF gun back over his shoulder, and began walking.
</p>
<p>
And he walked.
</p>
<p>
And walked.
</p>
<p>
He had no idea how much time had passed. He wore no watch, and his dead cellphone wouldn’t tell him the hour. The occasional car zoomed by, paying him no mind. He walked past gas stations, past strip malls, past ghostly-quiet four-way intersections whose stoplight signals changed color for nobody. 
</p>
<p>
Danny heard the hum of an engine slowing down behind him. He turned around.
</p>
<p>
Tina waved at him through the windows of Natalie’s car. “Danny! There you are!” she said as she pulled up beside him. “God, I’m glad to see you! I’ve been looking everywhere. You’re going the wrong way!”
</p>
<p>
Danny climbed into the passenger seat. “My cellphone’s dead. I have no GPS.”

<span class="caplead">In the cabin of Jason’s yacht,</span> Rosie and Moshen sat next to one another on the leather bench by the lacquered table. They had cleared out a space among the laptops and electronics, and filled it with markers and pencils and blank pieces of paper from Jason’s <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> kit. Moshen kept the girl distracted by flipping through the illustrated rulebooks and teaching her how to draw pictures of dragons, orcs, and fairies, of knights and priests and wizards. On the screen behind them, the conference call had stayed active, keeping Mike and Natalie telepresent. 
</p>
<p>
All eyes turned towards the cabin stairs as Danny, Tina, and Jason descended from the deck.
</p>
<p>
Rosie erupted in a joyous, expectant smile. Once the three of them descended, her smile lingered briefly, then sank into a perplexed frown.
</p>
<p>
“Where’s my Dad?” she asked nervously.
</p>
<p>
Danny’s face went pale. 
</p>
<p>
“Where’s my Dad!?” she repeated with fierce insistence.
</p>
<p>
Silent seconds drifted by. The child’s face slowly melted into a grimace of agonized horror. “<em>Where’s my Dad?</em>” she screamed, knowing the answer.
</p>
<p>
Danny tried to say something, but only stammered. The young girl stifled tears with a wet gulp. She sprang from her seat, pushed past Danny, and bolted up the steps. Danny watched her helplessly, his mouth agape.
</p>
<p>
Jason clasped a hand on Danny’s shoulder and said, “I’ve raised children of my own,” before briskly ascending the steep cabin stairway after her.
</p>
<p>
Danny’s eyes, wide with heartbroken delirium, drifted to each of his comrades in turn. “You… You guys didn’t tell her…?”
</p>
<p>
The cabin responded with silence. On the deck above, the child’s hysterical sobs shattered the night.
</p>
<p>
“What’s going to happen to her?” Danny asked, his stomach lurching.
</p>
<p>
Several more moments of silence passed. Tina finally broke it. “She has no other family. We asked her while we were waiting for you. She has nowhere to go.”
</p>
<p>
“Sergey was adamant that she doesn’t end up in foster care,” said Danny, his head spinning. “You remember, right? In my bedroom? He said a girl her age would never…”
</p>
<p>
“I remember, Danny.”
</p>
<p>
“Sergey told her to listen to me. That I’d protect her,” Danny leaned heavily against the wood-paneled cabin wall. “He told me to take care of her. Those were his last words.”
</p>
<p>
Tina gently began, “Danny, you didn’t…”
</p>
<p>
He cut her off. “<em>Because of me,</em> those were his last words.”
</p>
<p>
Natalie intervened via the screen. “Danny, listen to me. It’s natural to feel guilty over something like this. Possibly even indebted. But you couldn’t have known. What happened wasn’t your fault. Feelings of remorse are unnecessary right now.”
</p>
<p>
He listened to the child’s cries on the moonlit deck above. “What <em>should</em> I be feeling right now, then?”
</p>
<p>
Natalie responded, “How about, proud of yourself for simply getting out alive?”
</p>
<p>
Danny emitted a hollow, humorless chuckle. “The things I choose to perceive as meriting pride are pretty arbitrary, don’t you think?” 
</p>
<p>
The sobbing outside began to soften. Jason’s voice could be heard offering soothing, indistinct words.
</p>
<p>
Danny looked at Tina and locked eyes with her. “Remember what we talked about back in the Rite Aid, Tina?”
</p>
<p>
Tina nodded. “Of course I do, Danny. You talked about how you believed you had an unclaimed destiny of greatness. How you’re supposed to create something amazing that would shape the whole world. Something like that, yes?”
</p>
<p>
Danny smiled warmly. “Exactly. But… my own greatness isn’t really <em>about</em> me, is it? It never has been. That’s the whole point…”
</p>
<p>
Small, light footsteps descended behind him. Rosie had broken away from Jason above. With sobs still racking her small shoulders, she ran to Danny and buried her face against his shirt. 
</p>
<p>
He instinctively reached out to hug her, and stroked her hair as her whimpers tapered to silence. “I <em>do</em> want to create something amazing,” he said as he wiped the child’s tears. “I <em>do</em> want to shape the world. Maybe this is how.”
