      Danny, a onetime computer whiz-kid now in his late thirties, is still lamenting
      his latest dot-com failure when tech investor Jason Tuttle offers him a special 
      assignment: hack into Tungsten Medical Technologies and steal their pharmaceutical 
      research.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, Danny and his team of semi-competent geeks relish the chance to play-act 
      as cybercriminals, but they soon discover they aren't the only ones interested in 
      the secretive biotechnology firm. Their ill-timed computer shenanigans interrupt an 
      armed break-in of the laboratory by the Russian mafia, and Danny lands squarely in 
      the crosshairs of a local cocaine kingpin. He soon finds himself hunted by drug 
      dealers and exploited by Machiavellian corporate moguls in a battle over a test 
      tube of genetically engineered bacteria.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the help of Tina, an amateur microbiologist desperate for professional recognition, 
      Danny must use his technical skills to elude his powerful pursuers &mdash; and, 
      with luck, even beat them at their own game.
    </p>
