<span class="caplead">Client 4.7.3 played</span> before an adoring throng of pink-haired girls and slim-hipped guys. His electric guitar screamed in ecstasy beneath his motion-blurred fingers. The song finished, and he spread his arms to embrace the spotlight.
</p>
<p>
And felt sick to his stomach.
</p>
<p>
His life was a hedonistic montage of groupies, drugs, and mansions &mdash; and he hated every second of it. The sex, now so easy to get, was hollow and joyless. The drugs numbed him but brought him no pleasure. The mansions were only good for parties, and he could no longer stand the people he partied with. He was in his late thirties now, and finally admitting to himself that it was all shit.
</p>
<p>
He cancelled his tour. In the back of his garage, behind the sports cars and SUVs, he still kept the dented Ford F-150 that had brought him out to Los Angeles so many years ago. He started up that clanky old engine, and drove it all the way back to his home town. Down the street from his high school, a Blockbuster had been replaced by a coffee shop. He booked a gig there under his original name, and played a few sombre tunes that he had never gotten a chance to release because they didn’t fit his “image”. There were only six people in that audience, but he looked into each of their eyes as he sang. And when his set was over, he went out back for a cigarette, and sobbed with joy.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
“We’re still detecting photostimulation-induced emetic potentition.”
</p>
<p>
“I thought the nausea was part of the narrative this time.”
</p>
<p>
“Creative Control worked the defect into the storyboard with some very quick thinking. But it’s a bug, not a feature.”
</p>
<p>
“Alright. I’ll patch it in the next release build.”
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
Client 4.8.1 had vowed for years that someday she would just drop everything &mdash; her six-figure legal career, her Chelsea loft, her yoga studio &mdash; and go open a small cupcake shop in Maine. Her friends had always thought it was joke, a mere idle fantasy, until the day she finally mustered up the courage to do it. They told her she would hate it. She told <em>herself</em> she would hate it. But seeing people buy up her colorful puffballs, seeing their eyes light up when they took a bite and hearing that little squeal they made through a mouth full of soft deliciousness, gave her a genuine thrill every time. It was hard work, and business was frequently uneasy and uncertain. It definitely wasn’t always peaches and cream &mdash; not even the “Peaches ’n Cream”. Yet here she was, turning on her bakery lights at 5am on a frigid orange-leafed autumn morning, ready to bake a breakfast selection of Halloween-themed pastries. And she couldn’t be happier.
</p>
<p>
If only the lights in her eyes didn’t make her queasy for some reason…
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
“I thought you said you fixed that.”
</p>
<p>
“I thought I did! Here, come take a look…”
</p>
<p>
Daniel sat before a translucent screen wide enough to wrap in a half-circle around his desk. His head was silhouetted in its light &mdash; the smooth dome of his cranium, the loose strands around his temples, the fluffy silver fur around his chin.
</p>
<p>
The screen itself glowed with a maze of windows. Some held software develpment environments, with colorful cascades of indented text. Some held rotating three-dimensional wire-mesh diagrams of organic structures &mdash; some molecular, some neuroanatomical. Some displayed rendered animations of mundane scenes &mdash; a small-town coffee shop, a bakery in Maine.
</p>
<p>
But the window he focused on now was a long, jagged graph of parallel sensor readouts. 
</p>
<p>
“What do you think, T? I’m not doing that, am I?”
</p>
<p>
“You are.” Tina leaned her face beside his, studying the chart. She draped an arm over Daniel’s shoulder, and he reciprocated with a hand on the small of her back. The march of time had chiseled her contours into a firm visage of competence and confidence, smart and strong and feminine. She radiated a kind of mature beauty only expressed in those who have rightfully earned it. “The <em>area postrema</em> is extremely dopamine-sensitive. You’re trying too hard. Turn down the external stimulation. Don’t force it. Let the cognitive systems do the work. Let them come to their conclusions on their own.”
</p>
<p>
He smiled. “Ah. Of course. That <em>is</em> the entire point.”
</p>

<div class="chapsection">
<p>
<span class="caplead">Alyssa Crawford felt the cushion</span> beneath her back, the headset straps behind her ears. Her hands clutched at the armrests of her recliner, and she started to pull herself up. Tried to, anyway. Her fingers and arms felt clumbsy and weak &mdash; almost paralyzed.
</p>
<p>
“No no! Not yet! Take it easy. Let your mind come back into your body.” The woman’s soft voice was simultaneously soothing and authoritative, like a wise matriarch. “We’re going to take off your goggles now, alright? On the count of ten, nine, eight…”
</p>
<p>
The pale glowing nothingness lifted away, and her eyes regained focus. Before her, she saw the warm, kind face of her clinician, Dr. Natalie Rosenbaum-Braun.
</p>
<p>
“Your name is Alyssa Crawford,” Dr. Rosenbaum-Braun said in that calming yet powerful voice. “You’re a thirty-one-year-old divorce attorney in New York City. Right now you’re in Seattle, in the Life Choices Projection Clinic…”
</p>
<p>
As the doctor spoke, Alyssa slowly grew aware of medical equipment surrounding her &mdash; glowing displays of jumpy lines, transparent plastic bags of fluid hanging from metal clips. Tubes punctured her skin, running into her body through the back of her hand and the inside of her elbow. Nurses and technicians scurried around her, making announcements such as, “Prefrontal suppressors fully drained,” or, “Melatonin and GABA levels both back to baseline.”
</p>
<p>
“You were in an induced twilight-conscious REM-like state for just under two hours,” said the doctor as she removed a needle from Alyssa’s flesh.
</p>
<p>
Alyssa gasped. “It… It felt like <em>years</em>…”
</p>
<p>
“Talk to me about your experience,” Dr. Rosenbaum-Braun encouraged.
</p>
<p>
Alyssa struggled for words as reality returned to her. “I… I <em>knew</em> it was a simulation the whole time. But <em>while</em> it was happening, it didn’t matter, you know? You ever have dreams like that? Where you know it’s a dream, but that doesn’t change how real it all seems at the time? I came up with such a great recipe for a spice-infused devil’s food brownie… I… I’m trying to remember it now, but…”
</p>
<p>
The doctor smiled kindly. “Let’s not fixate on that. You didn’t <em>really</em> live through several years in the last few hours, after all. We just alter the way your brain records memories, to make you <em>remember</em> it as though you did. You can’t <em>really</em> learn new skills or build experience during the process. But the <em>effects</em> of having that skill and experience on you as a person &mdash; how they would affect your perception of yourself and the way you interact with the world &mdash; <em>that</em> part can teach us something. Let’s focus on <em>that</em>. How is Maine Cupcake Alyssa different from who you are now?”
</p>
<p>
Alyssa caught herself laughing. “Doctor… Real-Life Me does divorce litigation. When somebody hires me, they’re literally going through the worst times of their lives. And half the time, I just end up nurturing their bitterness and grievance and making it worse. But <em>in there</em>, I made people <em>happy</em>. I could <em>see</em> them smile before my eyes. And… I had no idea that something like that was missing from my life until now. Sure, I mean, it’s just a cupcake. It’s just a fleeting moment of pleasure. But it’s <em>real</em> pleasure, you know? I don’t know; maybe I’m doing more overall good in the world where I am now &mdash; or at least making there be less bad. But… maybe <em>I</em> don’t have to be the one doing it. It’s not like Manhattan has a shortage of divorce lawyers.”
</p>
<p>
Dr. Rosenbaum-Braun coaxed her to lift her head, and removed a flexible cap of electrodes from her skull, carefully separating it from her hair. “Let’s not be too hasty. You shouldn’t start making major decisions after <em>one</em> treatment. Eventually you might decide to practice a different kind of law. Or you might take on some volunteer work. Or you might change nothing &mdash; at least, not on the surface &mdash; but simply learn to see your current life and work in a different light.” The doctor held her hand and helped her stand up. “You’re certainly not alone. Many of our clients don’t know what they want until they see it played out before them. Some <em>think</em> they know what they want, only to find that actually <em>having</em> it brings them no joy. And others realize that the thing they thought they needed was something they already had all along. We get plenty of people wanting to choose a path of money and wealth and power, and they think that getting a taste of that life will give them the courage to pursue it &mdash; but they find that we can give them all of it and they’re still miserable. Or they <em>do</em> find fulfillment, but never for the reasons they think. There’s always some goal waiting one more step up on Maslow’s Hierarchy, and the higher you go the harder that goal is to recognize. And the easier it is to mistake things that <em>might</em> make you happy, things that other people will tell you will make you happy, with what actually will. That’s why we’re here.”
</p>
<p>
“Doctor, I do have one question,” Alyssa said, still unsteady on her feet. “Why exactly did two of my cupcakes grow arms and legs and start kung-fu fighting each other?”
</p>

<p>
<span class="caplead">“<em>God damn it, Moshen!</em>”</span> Daniel crashed through the double doors of the Realtime Creative Control Room.  
</p>
<p>
Moshen, giggling hysterically, sat at a desk similar to Daniel’s. His wraparound screen, however, was covered in tree-like diagrams and artistic sketches &mdash; a sort of nonlinear comic strip, where each square had three or four different panels that could potentially follow it. Unlike Daniel’s pristine console, Moshen’s workstation was littered with soda and Cheetos; and while Daniel’s monitor was translucent, the screen before Moshen’s face sported an animated background of knights and dragons. Moshen himself was neither small nor scrawny anymore; many long years of dedicated physical training had honed his body into a hard, wiry machine of powerful muscles. But he still laughed with the sly mirth of a prank-pulling adolescent boy.
</p>
<p>
“Do you think that was <em>funny</em>?” Daniel demanded.
</p>
<p>
Beside Moshen’s desk were two others, both as large and messy as his. Mike sat at one, his thick scruff now graying. His screen was strewn with pictures of people’s faces &mdash; some photographed, some rendered, and some simply cartoons &mdash; marked with paragraph bios and handwritten notes. At the other sat Rosie, grown well into adulthood, holding a stylus in her hand and wearing polarized glasses to view her console &mdash which was filled with 3D wireframe models of houses, furniture, trees, and shops. Above their desks, respectively, stood placards reading “PLOT”, “CHARACTER”, and “SETTING”. 
</p>
<p>
All three of them were silently laughing. Their shoulders shook, their eyes twinkled at him.
</p>
<p>
Daniel’s visage of sternness collapsed into a chuckle. “Alright, fine,” he said, feeling the skin at the corner of his eyes crinkle. “That <em>was</em> pretty cute, guys.”
</p>
<p>
From across the room, past the desks of two dozen other supporting employees, Daniel heard a loud, “Ahem!” Jason stood before a group of four investors, recognizable by the suits on the men and the shoulder pads on the women. With a voice growing dry with age, Jason called him over. “And here, folks, is the founder and CTO of this organization &mdash; as well as the inventor of a lot of these technologies.” The four murmured their approval.
</p>
<p>
“Co-inventor,” Daniel corrected as he walked over. “I couldn’t have done any of this without T. And none of it would work without the efforts of everyone in this room.”
</p>
<p>
“I was just explaining to these fine folks,” said Jason, “how the Realtime Creative team uses tools adapted from the entertainment industry to create stories for each client on the fly &mdash; a complete immersive sensory environment woven <em>as they experience it</em>. And by monitoring their reactions on a neurological level, we can tailor that environment in response to the clients’ therapeutical needs, completely seamlessly.”
</p>
<p>
In response to the investors’ oohs and ahhs, Daniel gestured downward with his palms to lower their expectations. “Now, now. It’s not as labor-intensive as it sounds. The truth is that we cheat. Because the client is in a dreamlike state, they merely need audiovisuals that <em>suggest</em> realism, and their own mind fills in whatever details we might have missed. For example, if we have a photo of their mother, we can show it to them on a model skin and converse with them through it, and afterwards they will think, ‘I had a conversation with my mother.’ They simply won’t think about the fact that the model’s mouth moved like a poorly dubbed anime character, or that she spoke with the voice of Mr. Braun over there. In some ways it’s less like a movie and more like an indie stage production &mdash; the props and scenery aren’t <em>really</em> going to fool anybody, but they don’t have to. They just have to be good enough to enable a willing suspension of disbelief, so that someone who <em>wants</em> to get into it, can.”
</p>
<p>
One of the investors asked, “So, during a session with a client, your Realtime Creative team uses this technology for a sort of improv theater show?”
</p>
<p>
Daniel looked back at the three desks. “We tend to think of it,” he said with a grin, “as a Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign.”
</p>
<p>
Another investor, a tall thin man with a crew cut, suddenly asked in a jarringly loud voice, “So you built all this with stolen millions?”
</p>
<p>
Daniel jerked his head back around. “I beg your pardon?”
</p>
<p>
“The Zheleznov fortune. Hey, I’m not judging, of course,” said the tall suited man, in a tone that contradicted his words. “But it’s the big unspoken secret about this place, right? Look, I read the same articles about you in <em>Time</em> and wired.com and Gawker as everyone else. You hacked into both Sergey Mukhayev’s and Ivan Zheleznov’s accounts. After they both wound up dead, you must have lived awfully comfortably, didn’t you?”
</p>
<p>
The other investors protested at his outburst, but Daniel calmed them down. “That <em>is</em> the impression that the popular media stories left you with. And I imagine it was intentional &mdash; controversy generates click revenue, after all. But let me clarify a few things. First of all, the police seized most of Sergey’s money. The little that was left, we were going to use for Leo’s legal defense fund. But he insisted we use it for private school and college for Rosie. That’s why Leo ended up taking the fall for the Mukhayev family’s involvement in the events of the Medina Gallante, and why he’s still in prison. Rosie still visits him regularly.”
</p>
<p>
The tall skeptical investor scoffed. “Okay, so that accounts for the molehill, but not the mountain. What about all the money in the Zheleznov consortium account?”
</p>
<p>
Daniel exchanged a wry look with Jason. “We never actually hacked that account.” He was met with four pairs of confused eyes &mdash; some with brows arched, others furrowed, some wide, others blinking. “We were able to deduce its balance, yes. But we never managed to crack into it. Ivan used an OTP keyfob, and all transfers required dual authentication. Even if we had gotten his password, we never would have been able to move funds into or out of it. Our promise to split the fortune among his men… It was a bluff. A piece of information that itself was fake, but designed to have a real effect. In other words, a hack.”
</p>
<p>
The investor looked around the room and said, “So where <em>did</em> the seed capital for all this come from?”
</p>
<p>
Daniel smiled wistfully. “From me, actually. But I was only able to do it thanks to this guy.” He jerked his thumb at Jason, who blushed. “When the assets of Tungsten, my old company, finally went up for auction, he used his personal funds to make winning bids on everything that I had personally developed during my years there. My patents, my code, my designs &mdash; all the intellectual property that I had produced while salaried for them, he bought up. And then… he gave it all to me. Gifted it. He called it a bonus.”
</p>
<p>
Jason bashfully added, “You were right from the very start, Dan. It was all rightfully yours.”
</p>
<p>
“I licensed my technologies to other cellular providers,” Daniel continued. “Verizon, mostly. And <em>that</em> is where I got the revenue to start building this place. And to live <em>pretty</em> comfortably, overall. Give Rosie a stable, loving home. Put T through the rest of her education. Marry her, and have two wonderful little boys. The thing is, I don’t know if I would even be <em>able</em> to enjoy any of it if it had come from stolen funds. But what T and I and the rest of us have created here, we’ve created ourselves.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re referring to Tina Giordano, yes?” asked one of the investors.
</p>
<p>
Daniel beamed. “This whole place is as much her work as it is mine. My background is electronics and software. I didn’t know squat about molecular biology or neuroscience. But the truth is that these fields have a lot more in common than most people realize. You see, it’s possible to understand the brain as neurochemical machinery. Thinking, feeling, wanting, dreaming &mdash; they’re all <em>physical</em> processes. When you understand how the components work, it becomes possible to analyze thoughts flowing through a human mind the same way you can analyze instructions flowing through a computer’s CPU. When a neurobiologist talks about what motivates a person, how a person perceives the world and acts on their desires… When you talk about that stuff armed with actual knowledge of how the brain operates, you’re not talking philosophy. You’re talking <em>engineering</em>. Now, I’m primarily a programmer by trade. I might not know neuroscience, but I know what it means to change the behavior of a data-processing machine. ‘Hack’ it, if you will. We each have the power to <em>reprogram ourselves</em>. This facility is simply a way to help people to that. A dev kit, if you will. The question is: What kind of apps will you write with it? And the answer is entirely for you to figure out.”

<span class="caplead">Clients 7.1.1, 7.1.2, and 7.1.3</span> filled out the forms, strapped the caps and goggles over their heads, let the nurses attach tubes to their bodies, and settled into their recliners. They didn’t know exactly what awaited them, but they could hardly wait to experience it. Reading reviews and listening to friends, they had heard that the process enabled them to discover what it would be like to live out their heart’s desires. And, in the process, possibly even discover what those desires might be.
