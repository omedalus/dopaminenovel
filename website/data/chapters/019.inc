<span class="caplead">
The fabric upholstery pressed against</span> Danny’s naked back, leaving a grid of tiny square crosshatches in his skin. His wounded shoulder throbbed beneath its gauze dressing, and his hand still stung from being cut and burned. 
</p>
<p>
The two men had not exchanged a single word. The trip was not silent, however. The middle-aged financier spent the time on his cellphone, speaking frantically into his Bluetooth headset. The conversations were brief and cheerful. They went along the lines of, “Hello, Mr. Cartwright…” “Ms. Yonath…” “Mr. Chew…” “Yes, everything’s just fine! Listen, I’m afraid I won’t be able to provide you with a sample after all… Yes, unfortunately the prototype is inaccessible. But … Yes, we’re absolutely still on…” Those were the ones that Danny could understand. The rest were in fluent German, French, and Mandarin.
</p>
<p>
Eventually, the conversations ended. The silence was even less palatable than the chatter. 
</p>
<p>
Jason finally said something. “So, I’m dropping you off at your house, I guess?”
</p>
<p>
“Yeah.” Danny looked at the clock above the car’s radio. “Who are you talking to, anyway?” he asked. “It’s two o’clock in the morning.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s five p.m. in Singapore.”
</p>
<p>
Danny turned to stare out the open window. He breathed the fresh night air deeply &mdash; he couldn’t stand his own stench of chemicals, sweat, and blood.
</p>
<p>
“We still don’t know who owns Tungsten,” Jason said.
</p>
<p>
“Excuse me?” Danny replied.
</p>
<p>
“The consortium. The ones who installed Dr. Passinsky. We still don’t know anything about them. I’ve got some deals in the works. Some info would really help.”
</p>
<p>
Danny shrank in his seat. “Computer hacking isn’t supposed to result in me running for my life.”
</p>
<p>
“I know,” said Jason. “I’m sorry. None of it was supposed to happen like this.” 
</p>
<p>
“You owe me more than an apology. You owe me an explanation.”
</p>
<p>
Jason stared forward. “I spent twenty years as Tungsten’s COO. I was your age when I took that position. Before that, Vice President of Operations. And before <em>that</em>, head of their Accounts Payable. I spent my whole life at that company. I took a sales position with them right out of college. They paid for my MBA. Thirty-five years, Danny. I’ve been with them for thirty-five years. You’re upset about the six years you sank into Claymore Communications, right? Well, I was with Tungsten for about as long as you’ve been alive. That company outlasted my marriage, Danny. I’ve known that company for longer than I’ve known my ex-wife.”
</p>
<p>
“Yeah, and now you’re bitter that they canned you,” Danny concluded. “And you just want to stick it to them by stealing their core project. Right?”
</p>
<p>
Jason shook his head. “That’s not it at all, Danny. I hold no grudge against them. Laying me off was the right move.”
</p>
<p>
Danny stared at him questioningly.
</p>
<p>
“Look, Tungsten was a reseller of high-end medical equipment since the seventies, right?” said Jason. “Its core business model was <em>sales</em>. Sales in the seventies and eighties. It was a different world back then, Danny. A world of business cards and Rolodexes and fax machines and power ties. Tungsten’s lifeblood was mail-order catalogs, cold-calls, and conference presentations. All the stuff that used to make business, business.
</p>
<p>
“And then, while I was COO, the Internet came. First email, then chat rooms, then the World Wide Web, then search engines and eBay and AdSense… and then it was game over. I watched Tungsten waste away under my watch. Look, I’m all about adapting to the times and sailing with the winds of change and all that corporate boardroom jazz. And I <em>did</em> learn a lot &mdash; enough to know my way around the dot-com world as an investor and venture capitalist. But with Tungsten, there was nothing I could do to keep it afloat. I managed its operations, and it withered and died in my arms. The world moves fast, Danny. You know that as well as anyone.”
</p>
<p>
Danny began to relax. “So you’re not in it for revenge. And you keep talking about your severance package and your dot-com investment stuff, so I assume you’re not in it for the money. So what are you doing all this for?”
</p>
<p>
“Redemption.”
</p>
<p>
Danny said nothing.
</p>
<p>
“My marriage fell apart, Danny. My kids hate me now. I haven’t talked to my ex-wife in years. And through the divorce and everything, it was all okay because… I mean, it wasn’t <em>okay</em>, obviously, but… at least I always had my work. I spent my lifetime building Tungsten, and it died on my watch. And now I need to find a way to <em>undo</em> that. To prove that I can make it work after all &mdash; the thing I’ve poured my whole life into. I need to prove that I can do <em>something</em> that doesn’t end in disaster and disappointment. That I’m not…” He cut himself off before finishing the sentence.
</p>
<p>
Danny asked, “How does stealing their intellectual property help anything?”
</p>
<p>
“It all has to do with a little problem with Tungsten’s paperwork,” said Jason, “that presents me with an interesting opportunity.” He hesitated before elaborating. “Danny, I was always totally honest when it came to Tungsten’s accounts. I swear to that. I never cooked the books. I never did any insider trading. Never. But… near the end there, with Tungsten circling the drain, I guess I just stopped caring… And I’ll admit I… got sloppy.”
</p>
<p>
Danny said nothing. He didn’t need to.
</p>
<p>
“Tungsten never formally declared bankruptcy,” Jason explained. “We never actually filed Chapter 11. We <em>started</em> the paperwork, of course. But I… never finished it. Now, most of our creditors, they just <em>assumed</em> that the filing went through, and, well… I never corrected them. So, they wrote off their investments in Tungsten as capital losses. When the creditors listed those writeoffs in their year-end tax filings, we treated that as <em>ipso facto</em> forgiveness of the debt, and cleared the balances from our ledgers. But both the write-offs and the debt forgiveness were based on misunderstandings &mdash; arguably <em>willful</em> misunderstandings &mdash; and neither would hold up in a court of law.”
</p>
<p>
“So, what you mean is…”
</p>
<p>
“What I mean,” said Jason, “is that Tungsten is carrying almost a hundred million dollars in unsettled debt, with compounding interest. When this Eastern European consortium bought that company, they unknowingly bought a bottomless money pit.”
</p>
<p>
“Then who are all these people you’re calling now?” Danny asked.
</p>
<p>
“They’re some of our old creditors,” said Jason. “I’ve been in contact with them. Several weeks ago, I casually informed them about Tungsten’s lack of legally filed bankruptcy paperwork. They found the news very troubling.”
</p>
<p>
Danny merely shook his head with incredulity.
</p>
<p>
“Tungsten’s assets are rightly theirs, you see,” Jason clarified. “The creditors are still entitled to come and collect. They can legally force Tungsten to sell off everything it owns and divvy up the money among them. And that’s what they were ready to do when I first told them about Tungsten’s little paperwork snafu. Their natural reflex is to put everything on the auction block and recoup whatever they can, right?”
</p>
<p>
Danny chuckled bitterly. “Like what you just did to <em>my</em> company, Claymore Communications. I’m seeing a pattern here. As above, so below?” 
</p>
<p>
“It’s all just business,” Jason replied. “But with Tungsten there’s more to it now. See, an auction of Tungsten’s assets would barely net a few million dollars at most. Tungsten’s lenders thought most of the company’s capital was tied up in the stockroom where they keep all the inventory, and the stuff in there is obsolete and getting progressively worthless. But Tungsten’s not a medical supply house anymore. It’s a biotechnology research firm now. And thanks to this nameless Eastern European consortium, Tungsten now has something that could be worth serious money.”
</p>
<p>
“So this whole mission tonight,” Danny followed, “was to provide proof that Tungsten is worth keeping. That it shouldn’t be disbanded, but kept around in its new form.”
</p>
<p>
“Exactly,” said Jason. “This consortium, whoever they are, was kind enough to find a way to do what I couldn’t: turn Tungsten around. Give it potential. Give it life. Give it relevance.”
</p>
<p>
“Uh-huh. And you’re going to reward them for their efforts by getting Tungsten’s old investors to swoop in and take it back from them.” 
</p>
<p>
Jason shrugged. “It is what it is,” he said distantly.
</p>
<p>
“And what’s in it for you?” Danny asked pointedly.
</p>
<p>
“The new investment group I’ve set up consists solely of international creditors,” said Jason. “I’ve made a deal with them. See, they’re going to need a new President and CEO. Someone local. Someone who’s been in the business his whole life. Someone who knows American corporate practices and who has experience running a company like this.”
</p>
<p>
“Right,” Danny said with a snort. “And, naturally, who better to take the reins than someone who not only has experience running a company <em>like</em> this, but actually running <em>this</em> company…”
</p>
<p>
“Exactly!” said Jason. 
</p>
<p>
“…into the ground,” Danny finished.
</p>
<p>
An angry glare flashed momentarily across Jason’s face. But in a blink, the middle-aged man pushed the rage away, and turned to gaze at the road ahead. He nodded humbly, and squared his jaw. “Not this time,” he said. “Not <em>this</em> time.”

<p>
<span class="caplead">The sight of his house</span> made Danny giddy with relief. The red pickup truck worked its way, Pac Man-like, through the grid of streets in the University District, until it finally came to park on the curb outside Danny’s front yard. The one-story structure, with its blue siding and brown roof and white door and attached two-car garage, had never looked so inviting. In his mind, Danny was already heading to his bedroom.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll send your payment by PayPal tomorrow,” Jason said with a tired voice.
</p>
<p>
Danny collected his HERF gun, carefully examining the torn power cables. “My payment?”
</p>
<p>
“For your services tonight,” Jason said. “You’ve sure as hell earned it.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh. Right,” he replied, taking off his seatbelt. “Yes, thanks.”
</p>
<p>
“So, I’ll call you tomorrow to discuss the consortium?” Jason asked.
</p>
<p>
Danny froze with his hand on the door handle. “What’s there to discuss?”
</p>
<p>
“I really would like to find out who they are,” said Jason. “I’ll pay you for the additional labor, of course.”
</p>
<p>
Danny slumped back into his seat with an intense frown. “I don’t want to do this anymore, alright?”
</p>
<p>
“But Danny, I <em>need</em> you…” Jason insisted.
</p>
<p>
“I’m not a hacker, Jason,” Danny replied. “This is Seattle. There’s dozens of top-notch hacker outfits you could hire, both legal and illegal. IOActive. Leviathan Security. The Ghetto Hackers. The Schmoo Group. There’s literally a thousand people in this city that would do a better job at this than me, for a lower price.”
</p>
<p>
“Danny, I don’t have any inroads to folks like that,” Jason defended. “It’s not like I can just type ‘Seattle hackers’ into Google and get contact information for…”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, you can,” Danny interrupted. “You can do <em>exactly</em> that. Try it.”
</p>
<p>
“Right. And I’m supposed to work with some random guy off the Internet who happens to be a semi-professional criminal?”
</p>
<p>
Danny glared at him. “For a <em>criminal</em> activity? Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“I need someone smart who could do the job,” Jason countered. 
</p>
<p>
“And you thought <em>I</em> would be the right guy for it?” Danny fired back. “I’m an engineer. I’m a builder, not a breaker. All this cloak-and-dagger bullshit isn’t what I do. <em>This</em> is what I do…” He held up his HERF gun. “<em>This</em> is what I do…” He held up his cellphone. “I don’t do <em>this</em>…” He fished Eugene’s hacked Pantech out of his pocket. “…And I sure as shit don’t do <em>this</em>…” He turned his shoulder to display the dressing over his bullet wound. “You think I want to keep working with you? Are you <em>kidding me</em>? Right now, all I want is to rewind back to yesterday afternoon, when you offered me this little project, so I could tell you, ‘No, thanks.’ And in that alternate universe, I’ve spent all night tonight updating my LinkedIn profile and fiddling with my resume and flipping through job openings on Craigslist, and right now I’m staying up late re-playing Skyrim because I know I don’t have work tomorrow. <em>That’s</em> where I’m supposed to be. <em>That’s</em> my life. <em>That’s</em> my home universe. But instead, I’m <em>here</em>. And <em>here</em>, I’ve spent the night… in…”
</p>
<p>
He looked down at himself, at his shirtless torso and his wounded hand. He felt his shoulder throbbing. He took a long, slow, deep breath. 
</p>
<p>
“I’m sorry, Jason.” He popped the car door open. “You want to continue this insanity? You’ll have to do it without me. Find some other pet cybermonkey to sic on your business rivals. I’m done.”
</p>

<div class="chapsection">
<p>
<span class="caplead">Staccato beeps sounded outside </span>Danny’s front door as he punched in his keycode. The digital lock chirped and the deadbolt slid away under the pull of a solenoid. In the dark, the door’s insulation foam swished softly against the stone tiles in the entryway. Tired hiking-booted feet dragged themselves inside. Motion sensors detected a human-sized infrared blob, and the main room’s lights gently came to life to welcome Danny’s return.
</p>
<p>
Danny’s home was spacious but simple. His foyer, kitchen, and living room formed one continuous L-shaped expanse which wrapped around his bedroom and bathroom. Ahead of him, the large kitchen was demarked by a granite-topped peninsula counter. To his side, the living room contained his black leather sofa, his carefully arranged surround-sound speakers, and an enormous entertainment system built to house a large LED TV and countless different kinds of gaming consoles both modern and vintage. A myriad of remotes and game controllers lay scattered on the coffee table, beside a metal arcade-style <em>Dance Dance Revolution</em> mat that lay nestled in the gray carpet. Soft spiraling tracks around the furniture marked the latest trip by the Roomba that sat resting in its recharging station.
</p>
<p>
Danny’s first destination was through another door in the foyer, which led to his attached garage. Half of the space inside was dedicated to his Toyota Prius and his washer and dryer. The other half Danny had built into a digital electronics workshop. A solder-stained workbench formed the heart of his home laboratory, ringed by an oscilloscope, a logic analyzer, a naked computer with attached EEPROM burner, a box of Arduino boards, a whiteboard covered with equations and diagrams, and a wall full of small Plexiglas drawers holding assorted breadboard components. 
</p>
<p>
He laid the HERF gun on his workbench, prepared some heat-shrink insulation for the severed cables, and heated up a soldering iron. With his hand still smarting from its injuries, with his torso still naked except for the gauze wrapping on his shoulder, with his brain still reeling from the fumes and the blood loss and the exhaustion, he nonetheless tended carefully to the beloved patient on his workbench. The surgery only took a minute. A few gentle dabs of solder and some hoarse blasts from a heat gun, and the high-voltage device was restored to operational status. 
</p>
<p>
Before going back into the house, Danny found a spare power outlet and plugged the HERF gun into the wall. The lights in the garage dimmed. He left the device to feed for the night.
</p>
<p>
He shuffled zombie-like to the bathroom, determined to cleanse himself of the stink of jet fuel and nail polish remover and soot and blood. His shower was very long and very hot, and when he finally emerged from the steam he felt freshly baptized. He found his home first-aid kit and clumsily reapplied his shoulder dressing, and treated his hand with bandages and salve. He dressed himself in pajamas, turned off the lights, and stumbled to his bedroom. He let himself fall into bed, closed his eyes, and wrapped the blankets around his body.
</p>
<p>
The doorbell rang.
</p>
