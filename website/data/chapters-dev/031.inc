<span class="caplead">Seattle’s downtown skyline glinted</span> brightly in the warm sunlight of a clear summer day. Tall buildings rose above the shoreline, their windows shimmering with reflections of surf and sky. They towered above parks where children and dogs played; above markets raucous with bustling tourists and busking musicians; above sparkling blue waters teeming with yachts and freighters. The ribbon of urban expanse ran between Elliott Bay on one side and Lake Washington on the other. The blue Olympic Mountains crowned the western horizon, the gray Cascades and the enormous sleeping volcano of Mount Rainier lined the east. Tucked amidst majesty of geological proportions, the man-made spires jutted upward from low-lying gray urban periphery like immense gemstones from rock &mdash; the obsidian shard of the Columbia Tower, the waterfall mesa of sandstone and sapphire at 1201 Third, the bizarre white alien stalagmite of the Space Needle. Seattle wasn’t merely adorned with jewels; she was made of them. She was the Emerald City.
</p>
<p>
“Now, I know what you’re thinking,” said the throaty, energetic voice of a young man freshly in his twenties. “The nutrient requirements for a eukaryote are way too complex to maintain in a consumer device. Fortunately, we don’t need the organism to survive the manufacturing process. Each cell only lives long enough to differentiate and then grow its respective components &mdash; photoemission tubes, conductor channels, phosphor beads, whatever. The cell creates these structures out of semi-rigid nonliving materials like keratin and lignin. They remain intact even after the cell dies. Like wood, or coral.”
</p>
<p>
On an upper floor of a soaring corporate tower, at the end of a long marble-floored lobby, there stood a pair of wide glass double doors. Frosted upon their surface were the words, “Tuttle Investment Partners.”
</p>
<p>
In the Tuttle office’s anteroom, beside the reception desk, stood a museum-like pedestal lined with red felt. Upon it, the ramshackle HERF gun prototype, built out of PVC and held together by Velcro and karabiners, sat inside a glass case, like some kind of curious historical artifact from a by-gone era. Which it was.
</p>
<p>
Video display monitors, barely thicker than paper, hung from the ceiling of the reception area. The monitors showed proud videos of Tuttle projects. One presented a focused young woman carefully measuring the electrical current flowing through an organic-looking fractal assembly. One displayed an aging paraplegic playing the piano with a hand built of polymer and silicon. One had a Navy admiral demonstrating an unmanned aquatic scouting robot darting through the water with a dolphin-like tail.
</p>
<p>
And another displayed a title screen announcing, “Tuttle Investment Partners is a proud sponsor of the Mukhayev Memorial Foundation.” Talking heads gave closed-captioned testimonials about overcoming drug addiction.
</p>
<p>
A woman’s voice spoke. It was mature and confident, well-educated and self-assured. “I’m noticing that your photoemission tube is remarkably similar to the ommatidium of an insect eye. In fact, if I’m not mistaken, are those supposed to be pigment cells at the top?”
</p>
<p>
“They are!” the young man announced. “You’re absolutely right: we based our pixels on a compound eye design. We figured, if an insect eye can <em>receive</em> directional light rays, just run it in reverse and you can use the same structure to <em>project</em> them. Think of an insect’s eye as a sampling device for one spatial point in a 5D light field, right? Lay them out on a 2D grid and use them as phototransmitters, and what do you get? A lenticular display that renders a full three-dimensional image autostereoscopically from any point in a 120-degree viewing cone. And <em>that</em> is the whole point of this project! What we’re proposing is a standard free-viewing 3D 12K television screen &mdash; but it’s one that’s <em>grown in a vat</em> rather than assembled in a factory. And, now, naturally, we can’t get very far without venture capital &mdash; that is, obviously, why we’re here &mdash; but we’re hoping that Tuttle Investment Partners can see the potential of this proposal.”
</p>
<p>
The woman’s voice said, “So, I understand why you’re working with eukaryotes. You need these cells to differentiate into some extremely complex, precisely positioned structures. But this is one hell of a chimera you’re proposing. Your progenitor organism is a species of algae, right? A diatom? And you’re talking about taking that diatom and throwing in genes from ferns, from fungi, from at least three or four different phyla of animal. Now, obviously, you know that natural genomes &mdash; especially eukaryotic ones &mdash; have evolved extensive mechanisms to protect themselves against exogenous DNA. And you’re not only talking about having them express a protein or two, but actually exhibit entirely new morphologies. Isn’t that going to be, you know… hard?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, we’re not really doing anything that hasn’t been done before,” the young man assured. “The differentiation and expression processes can be reliably controlled through pretty standard cellular multiplexing techniques. I mean, you’re right &mdash; we’re porting entire anabolic pathways. But we’re basing our work on some solid precedents…”
</p>
<p>
The speaker stood in a small corporate conference room just beyond the reception hall. Behind him, a large presentation screen displayed a rotating protein structure. He was tall and charismatic, and brimmed with infectious excitement as he discussed his work.
</p>
<p>
His partner, a slightly older student with a heavy-set body and a shy demeanor, stood quietly on the opposite side of the screen.
</p>
<p>
“See, we found an excellent research paper,” the charismatic presenter continued. “It was from about twelve, thirteen years ago, something like that. Co-authored by researchers named Passinksy and Yen. We can forward it to you if you like.”
</p>
<p>
The woman chuckled. “That won’t be necessary.”
</p>
<p>
The heavy-set partner slapped his palm against his forehead.
</p>
<p>
The young man persisted, “It’s pretty old by now, but it’s really an interesting read. Apparently they were part of the benzoylmethylecgonine project at Tungsten Medical Technologies…”
</p>
<p>
The heavy-set partner stepped toward the young man and quickly whispered something into his ear.
</p>
<p>
The presenter’s eyes went wide and his cheeks reddened with embarrassment.
</p>
<p>
The woman said bemusedly, “I am quite familiar with the research of Tungsten Medical Technologies.”
</p>
<p>
The voice belonged to Tina. She sat at a small conference table, watching the presentation and taking notes. She wore a crisp, conservative business dress. The march of time had chiseled the contours of her face into a firm visage of competence and confidence, smart and strong and feminine. She radiated a kind of mature beauty only expressed in those who have rightfully earned it.
</p>
<p>
The presenter, still fumbling from the revelation just whispered to him by his heavy-set partner, said with awe, “<em>You’re</em> the ‘T. Giordano’ who…?”
</p>
<p>
“…Who submitted the Tungsten papers for posthumous publication, yes,” Tina said with a smirk.
</p>
<p>
As the young man stammered uncomfortably, Tina turned to her side and said jokingly, “Looks like this guy doesn’t know his audience too well. That’s a critical presentation failure, isn’t it? What do you think, Dan? Is that a deal-breaker?”
</p>
<p>
Daniel sat at the table beside her, wearing a timeless gray business suit. The color of his clothes matched the tone of his hair, which had receded high above his forehead to form a salt-and-pepper crown. The hair he had lost from the top of his head, he made up for with a neatly trimmed beard, dark with flecks of silver around his chin.
</p>
<p>
“Eh. I say cut him some slack,” he said, the creases at the corners of his mouth and eyes deepening as he smiled. “I remember giving a presentation to an investor group myself a long time ago, and I didn’t know that one of my audience members was affiliated with Tungsten Medical, either. Of course, back then, the term ‘cellular multiplexing’ meant something completely different.”
</p>
<p>
A device in Daniel’s hand suddenly buzzed with a gentle, quiet vibration. Daniel glanced down at the screen. A pop-up window bore the words, “<span class="computer">Rosie: 8 unread messages (22 unread total).</span>”
</p>
<p>
One side of the pop-up was dominated by a cropped square image of Rosie’s face. She used her glamour shot for her profile picture, which meant that every time she called or messaged, he saw her pressing her fingers erotically against her glossy purple lips, looking sensuously upward with mascara-rimmed eyes below a mane of iridescent platinum hair. The image made him feel awfully awkward every time. He flicked the pop-up away.
</p>
<p>
“On a more serious note, though, I do have a few concerns,” Daniel said as he put the device back down. “For starters, then there’s the matter of heat buildup. You’ve got power-consuming, light-emitting elements packed within less than a micron of each other. By definition, they’re going to go through a hell of a lot of joules per second. Where do you think all that energy is going to go?”
</p>
<p>
The young man meekly said, “Um… out?”
</p>
<p>
Daniel chuckled. “Look, here’s what I know. I’ve been here for close to ten years now, and I still don’t know squat about the biology end of things. But I do know that your entire finished product is going to be made of carbon-based molecules. And you know what I do know about carbon-based molecules? They’re flammable.”
</p>
<p>
His device buzzed again. He peeked at the screen. “<span class="computer">Rosie: 9 unread messages (23 unread total).</span>”
</p>
<p>
He looked up at the two young hopeful bioengineers. Their faces were anxious and self-conscious.
</p>
<p>
“Gentlemen,” Daniel said apologetically. “I hate to be rude, but will you excuse me for a minute?” Without awaiting a response, he turned away in his chair and focused his attention on his device.
</p>
<p>
He maneuvered to the fresh pile of messages in his Inbox. The texts from Rosie weren’t at the top of his queue. Instead, he first had to flip through several messages that fell under a heading titled, “<span class="computer">HALF-CENTURY BIRTHDAY BLOWOUT!!11!one!</span>”
</p>
<p>
Beside each message, the device displayed familiar faces.
</p>
<p>
“<span class="computer">Dude! Your 50th birthday? We wouldn’t miss it for the world! Count us in 110%!</span>” announced one message, beside a picture of Mike and Natalie. They’d been married for almost a decade. Their youngest child had just entered pre-school. Natalie had her own clinical practice. Mike worked as a network administrator for REI’s corporate offices. In their free time, they made costumes and crafts for the Washington Midsummer Renaissance Faire. They were ridiculously happy.
</p>
<p>
“<span class="computer">Wow, 50!!!! I vaguely remember it. :) I’ve got venue, catering, and entertainment all lined up. It’ll be a gala! Don’t you worry about a thing, D. I’m taking care of everything. Get plenty of rest the night before. You’re going to need it, old man! Welcome to the other side of the hill!</span>” The message was from Jason, whom Daniel hadn’t seen much of lately. Jason’s health was faltering &mdash; he was fighting an aggressive case of pancreatic cancer. His oncology clinicians routinely programmed new strains of custom-built viruses to attack the cancerous cells, but the cells kept evolving new mutations to resist the virotherapy. Despite the arms race being waged within his bloodstream, Jason’s spirits were quite high, and his friendship with Danny and the projects of Tuttle Investment Partners brought him fulfillment.
</p>
<p>
“<span class="computer">Daniel. It would be my pleasure to see you again, old friend,</span>” wrote Satish. “<span class="computer">My wife and daughters have not seen America yet, and it was very kind and thoughtful of you to include them on the invitation. It’s a long flight from Mumbai, but we’ll make it happen.</span>” 
</p>
<p>
“<span class="computer">Sure!</span>” Moshen replied. “<span class="computer">See you there.</span>” Moshen still made a decent living with his web design work. He couldn’t rightly be thought of as a “kid” anymore; he was married now, and would soon probably have kids of his own. In his spare time, he penned a popular online comic. It was about kung fu.
</p>
<p>
Finally, Danny found the litany of texts from Rosie.
</p>
<p>
“<span class="computer">Dan my suit isn’t working. Can you fix it?</span>”
</p>
<p>
“<span class="computer">Dan suit isn’t working. Please come fix it?</span>”
</p>
<p>
“<span class="computer">I’m supposed to be doing a dress rehearsal right now but my suit is broken!!! I can rehearse without it but I need it tonight.</span>”
</p>
<p>
“<span class="computer">FUCK DAN I’M IN DEEP SHIT. Since Sliced Bread watched me rehearsing and she’s all like ‘Where’s your suit?’ and I’m like, ‘It’ll be working by showtime I PINKIE-SWEAR! DAN PLEASE PLEASE HELP!</span>”
</p>
<p>
“<span class="computer">God Dan I’m starting to fraz here. HELP MEEEEEEEEEEEEE!</span>”
</p>
<p>
“<span class="computer">It ons alright, but then it turds out this message ‘Segmentation Fault: NullPointerException in IOBuffer::integrateFrame’ WTF?</span>”
</p>
<p>
“<span class="computer">Shit, I think I just made it worse...</span>”
</p>
<p>
“<span class="computer">DAN I CAN’T GO ON WITHOUT MY SUIT! DO YOU GET? I’M OPENING FOR SINCE SLICED BREAD! WHERE ARE YOU?</span>”
</p>
<p>
“<span class="computer">Hello...?</span>”
</p>
<p>
Daniel sighed gently and put the device away. He looked back and forth at Tina and the young men. They had patiently waited for him to finish.
</p>
<p>
“I’m so sorry,” he said. “I have to go.”
</p>
<p>
Tina asked him, “Is everything alright?”
</p>
<p>
“Yeah,” he said. “Rosie’s just freaking out. Or ‘frazzing’ or whatever the hell the kids say today.”
</p>
<p>
“Her show isn’t until eight o’clock,” Tina said. “She wants you there right now?”
</p>
<p>
“Yeah,” Daniel replied.
</p>
<p>
“What for?”
</p>
<p>
“Tech support.” Daniel stood up and began walking out of the room.
</p>
<p>
The charismatic young man said, crestfallen, “Wait, so… Our organic autosteroscopic video system…”
</p>
<p>
“Yes?” Daniel said.
</p>
<p>
“You, uh, so… You don’t think it’ll work, do you?”
</p>
<p>
A shrewd smile crept onto Daniel’s face. “I didn’t say that, did I?”
</p>
<p>
Relief washed over the two young men. They exchanged enthusiastic looks.
</p>
<p>
“Listen,” said Daniel. “You kids have a lot of very, very hard work ahead of you. But Tuttle Investment Partners might be able to help you out.” He gave them a warm smile. “Let me forward you some work I did back in the ‘90s. My master’s thesis was on thermal dissipation in 3D VLSI design. If you don’t want your first prototype to explode in a ball of fire, I’d recommend giving it a good careful read.”
</p>
<p>
The two young men had complex expressions on their faces, showing equal parts happiness, excitement, and fear. “Thank you,” the presenter said to him.
</p>
<p>
Danny walked around the small conference table toward where Tina sat. “And as for you…” He leaned his head down toward hers, and the two of them exchanged a warm, loving kiss. “I’ll see you tonight at Rosie’s concert?”
</p>
<p>
“Hell yeah,” Tina answered. “I already talked to the babysitter &mdash; she’ll pick the kids up from school, and we’re good ‘til morning.”
</p>
<p>
“Perfect,” said Daniel. “I’ll meet you in the VIP booth.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s the name of the band she’s opening for?” Tina asked.
</p>
<p>
“‘Since Sliced Bread’,” Daniel replied.
</p>
<p>
The two bioengineers by the screen suddenly jumped with excitement. “Holy shit! You guys have a VIP booth at the Since Sliced Bread concert?” 
</p>
<p>
Daniel shrugged. “Yeah. You two want to come?”
</p>
<p>
The young men’s eyes went wide. The presenter looked like he was about to choke. He nodded his head so rapidly that Daniel could practically hear the kid’s brain jostling.
</p>
<p>
“Heh. I take it they’re popular?” Daniel asked.
</p>
<p>
“Since Sliced Bread?” the presenter said. “Jesus Christ! She’s, like… oh my God, she’s… she’s…”
</p>
<p>
“You mean ‘they’, right?”
</p>
<p>
“No, I mean ‘she’,” said the young man. “Since Sliced Bread is the performer. She’s a solo act.”
</p>
<p>
“‘Since Sliced Bread’ is a girl’s name now?” Daniel asked.
</p>
<p>
“Yeah.”
</p>
<p>
Daniel shook his head. “Christ, I’m getting old.”
</p>
</div>

<div class="chapsection">
<p>
<span class="caplead">Rosie greeted him completely naked</span> at the door to her backstage dressing room, with the arm of a very muscular young man draped around her sculpted waist.
</p>
<p>
“Dan! Thank fucking Jesus!” she exclaimed, slowly emphasizing each word. She turned around, pivoting in place unthinkingly with perfect poise. She briskly padded barefoot across the disheveled room, moving effortlessly with a dancer’s grace.
</p>
<p>
Her beefy boy-toy watched her with rapture in his eyes. Daniel knew that look. He’d seen it on every gentleman-caller Rosie had ever brought home. Whoever this fellow was, he was already hopelessly, agonizingly in love with her. He’d never see her again.
</p>
<p>
“It’s over here!” she called from somewhere inside the cluttered chamber. Several young men and women puttered around, examining instruments and equipment. One lean geeky-looking guy sat in a chair in front of a clothing rack, looking intently at a tablet. Rosie looked down at him and shooed him with her hands, saying, “Ksssst! Scat!” The guy scurried out of the chair, leaving the tablet on the floor nearby.
</p>
<p>
Daniel took a few awkward steps inward, avoiding looking in her direction. “Rosie, could you maybe put on a robe or something?”
</p>
<p>
Rosie flicked her hand manically at the clothes rack. “Just… just fix it! Please?”
</p>
<p>
The rack only held one garment. On a hanging scaffold, with arms outstretched and legs pulled straight, was Rosie’s suit.
</p>
<p>
The outfit was a one-piece jumpsuit custom-fitted to conform to every inch of Rosie’s supple flesh like a second skin. Like a scuba suit, it left only the head and hands exposed.
</p>
<p>
Unlike a scuba suit, it was completely transparent.
</p>
<p>
It was made from a material that felt to the touch like something between cellophane and polyester. A flexible column of gray opaque plates ran down the spine and across the shoulders; the plates bore various kinds of jacks for both data and power, as well as elaborate heatsink structures. At certain angles of light, the glint of microscopically thin metallic fibers could be seen shimmering outward from the gray spinal column and weaving through the clear material.
</p>
<p>
With a grunt, Daniel bent down to pick up the tablet dropped by the geeky young man whom Rosie had shooed away. The tablet displayed a tracelog file. Danny examined it for a few seconds, and his brow furrowed. “Hmm…”
</p>
<p>
He stepped up to the jumpsuit, reached toward its gray opaque spine, and pressed the power button. 
</p>
<p>
From neck to toe, the material of the suit immediately turned solid black.
</p>
<p>
Bars of color appeared down one thigh, indicating battery level, temperature, storage capacity, and CPU and memory utilization.  
</p>
<p>
Blocky gray text began to materialize line by line across the suit’s breast, distorted by the curvature of the display fabric.
</p>

<pre class="computer">

</pre>

<p>
The text cascaded in gray sheets down the surface of the suit, warping and bending along the shape of the garment. When it hit the navel, it began scrolling.
</p>
<p>
After several moments, the text read: “<span class="computer">DisplaySuit diagnostic sequence. Stand by...</span>”
</p>
<p>
The text at the navel then suddenly spat out: “<span class="computer">Segmentation fault (core dumped)</span>”. The suit performed no further theatrics.
</p>
<p>
“See?” Rosie whined. She stood at a nearby closet, slipping into a bathrobe. “That’s all it does! It gets to that, and then it just stops like a little bitch…”
</p>
<p>
Daniel raised a hand and motioned for her to calm down, and studied the tablet. After about twenty seconds, he let out a slight chuckle. “Well, duh,” he said, staring at stack trace listings and hexadecimal pointer values. “Here’s your problem…”
</p>
</div>

<div class="chapsection">
<p>
<span class="caplead">Fixing the DisplaySuit took longer</span> than Daniel had hoped. The device was a rejected military prototype for an invisibility suit, originally developed as part of a Tuttle Investments project in conjunction with DARPA, MITRE, Raytheon, and Lytro. There were only a dozen other working machines like it in the world. The project was ultimately scrapped; the display technology still had no hope of fooling the human eye. It would take more than a fancy fabric of lights to outwit a hundred million years of neurocortical evolution.
</p>
<p>
But human cognition and ingenuity were products of that very same evolutionary process. Humans like Daniel were quite clever beasts, and they were working on it.
</p>
<p>
And just because the device was worthless as an invisibility suit didn’t mean it couldn’t still be used for one trippy piece of performance art. Or whatever word the kids used instead of “trippy” nowadays.
</p>
<p>
The hours ticked by as Daniel worked, setting breakpoints and altering in-memory values. Rosie rehearsed in her bathrobe, and grew steadily more nerve-racked with each passing minute. Her hunky male groupie found himself being desperately clung to one minute, only to be screamed at and cast away the next with no warning or provocation. Her bandmates, designers, and technicians scurried around her like a pit crew, doing everything in their power to ensure that she could operate at peak performance.
</p>
<p>
Daniel got the suit working about two hours before showtime. 
</p>
<p>
Rosie began pulling it on before Daniel could even complete a power cycle. “God! Thank you, yes! You’re the best, Dan!” Daniel turned aside as she dropped her robe to the floor and began slipping her naked body into the transparent material.
</p>
<p>
“You know, Rosie, you’d be fine even without the suit,” Daniel said, facing away. “You’re incredibly talented. Your performance will stand on its own merits.”
</p>
<p>
“You’d think so, wouldn’t you?” she said bitterly. “But the truth is, talent is cheap. All ‘talent’ gets you is a job playing synth for the background music of an HBO miniseries. And in the meantime, there’s a thousand turdhole pop-groups that can’t hit two chords, that are booked solid for years on end.” She ran her hands up along her long, shapely legs to squeeze out pockets of air. “Talent alone gets you nowhere. It takes talent, and luck, and passion, and that still isn’t enough. I mean, fuck, Dan. I’m almost twenty-five. You know what the 27 Club is, right? Jimi Hendrix. Jim Morrison. Amy Winehouse. Kurt Cobain. Janis Choplin. Tricia Ferrel. A real performer is supposed to be dead at 27. Tupac died at 25. Biggie Smalls died when he was 24. Think about that. He’d already had his entire career, started and finished, by the time he was 24. I’m 24, and where am I? Everything I’ve done up to now has been coffee houses and indie festivals. If I don’t break out tonight, I’ll wind up playing bar mitzvahs and high school reunions until the day I die. Which will probably be 27 anyway, because I’d rather just shoot myself and get it over with.” 
</p>
<p>
She rolled her shoulders to straighten the plates on her back. One of her lackeys zipped her up from behind.
</p>
<p>
“So, here I am,” she continued, flexing her limbs inside the suit to smooth out any kinks and wrinkles. “I’ve got talent, and I’ve got passion, and I’ve got this unbelievable lucky break where Since Sliced Bread is letting me open for her tonight. So I have to ask myself, what else can I do? How can I push myself over the edge? What can I bring to the audience that nobody else in the industry, nobody else in the <em>world</em>, can give them?” She patted her sides to gesture towards the suit. “This. I can give them this. Yeah, it’s just a gimmick, but fuck it. I’ll take any advantage I can get.”
</p>
<p>
The suit, now operational, responded to her movements with iridescent ripples that shimmered across her skin like waves upon an ocean of pure fluid energy. Flicks of her wrist and twitches of her ankles sent ribbons of light spinning like whirlwinds upon her body.
</p>
<p>
They moved to the stage to rehearse. With her crew in place, Rosie sauntered forward and waved to an imaginary audience. Shining upon her swaying form, swirls of ethereal color complemented her motions. She looked immaterial, transcendent, detached from physical reality, like a being that belonged to a different plane of existence &mdash; one purer, more celestial, more proximate to God.
</p>

<p>
<span class="caplead">Daniel sat beside Tina</span> in the VIP booth beside their two young guests, above a chattering crowd of tragically hip teenagers and twentysomethings slowly growing more inebriated. On the stage, Rosie’s bandmates stood at the ready, tense and anxious. It was fifteen minutes past showtime.
</p>
<p>
Daniel’s Scroll buzzed with an incoming message.
</p>
<p>
“<span class="computer">Dan thank you sooooo much again for saving my ass with the suit,</span>” Rosie typed. 
</p>
<p>
“<span class="computer">No problem,</span>” he replied. “<span class="computer">Glad I could help. Everybody out here is super excited for you! You should get out here already. :-)</span>”

</div>

<p>
A minute passed with no reply. Suddenly, the lights cut out, and the crowd began to howl and cheer. The delicate chords of an intricate harmony began to echo from the lightless depths of the stage.
</p>
<p>
A glowing figure appeared, dancing through the darkness like an angel across the void of space. It looked not human, but something beyond humanity &mdash; an incarnation of ingenuity and sensuality, an embodiment of mind and spirit. She was a creature born of technology and biology, a unity between mankind’s origin and destination wrapped in song and motion.
