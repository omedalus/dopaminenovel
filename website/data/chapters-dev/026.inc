<span class="caplead">Pyotr Passinsky watched calmly</span> as one of the Russian bodyguards blasted another’s skull open with a Dragunov rifle. 
</p>
<p>
“Boom! Headshot!” the sniper cheered.
</p>
<p>
“Son of a bitch!” yelled the victim, and slammed his PlayStation controller on the glass coffee table. 
</p>
<p>
“Easy, brother!” the assassin said, laughing. “It’s not the table’s fault you suck ass.”
</p>
<p>
“Shut it, dick-muncher,” he replied. “I’ve seen you with a real Dragunov. You can’t shoot your way out of a wet paper bag.”
</p>
<p>
Another mercenary broke away from a heavy petting session with a waifish whore in one corner of the wide leather couch. He slid over and grabbed the controller. “My turn!”
</p>
<p>
Passinsky, for his part, merely gazed at the graphics, marveling over the game system’s capabilites. 
</p>
<p>
They sat in a red-carpeted sunken living room inside the Presidential Suite of the Medina Gallante, a luxurious penthouse built of cedar, marble, and glass. The young men had co-opted the enormous TV hanging on one wall to rowdily challenge each other in <em>Call of Duty</em>. Throughout the suite, a dozen or so brash men in their twenties and thirties chatted and drank beer and fiddled with loaded handguns.
</p>
<p>
On the coffee table, there sat a crystal punch-bowl filled with fine white powder. It was freely available to the men to enjoy at their discretion. At the moment, the contents of the bowl were being gently picked at by the hot-pink fingernails of an anorexic young woman with more make-up than clothing. She, too, was there strictly for the men’s enjoyment, provided free of charge as a perk of employment by Ivan Zheleznov.
</p>
<p>
A spiral staircase wound upwards through the high ceiling to the bedrooms above. French doors opened to a balcony overlooking Lake Washington and the Seattle skyline, the city silhouetted in rich hues of orange and pink as the sun set behind the Olympic Mountains.
</p>
<p>
There was a quiet muttering from outside the room. The men perked their ears. With a press of a button, the video game system went mute.
</p>
<p>
The entrance of the Presidential Suite of the Medina Gallante was a pair of large cedar doors, latched with wide curving brass handles. One of those handles turned.
</p>
<p>
In a blink, every man snapped his full attention to the entryway. Those who were sitting jumped to stand; those who were standing crouched into attack postures. Prostitutes were unceremoniously thrown aside. Handguns leaped from holsters and pointed at the door. Metallic clicks echoed through the room as safeties switched off, hammers cocked, cylinders spun, and slides latched.
</p>
<p>
Through the door came a rasping, gravelly voice. “Easy, boys! It’s just me!”
</p>
<p>
The double doors swung open, pushed apart by the arms of a cavalier middle-aged man in a three-piece suit. In the entryway stood the silver-haired, beak-nosed figure of Ivan Zheleznov. He strutted in like a king among loyal peasants. The mercenaries hooted greetings.
</p>
<p>
Passinsky rose from the deep couch. He stood humbly and greeted Ivan with a deferential nod.
</p>
<p>
Ivan’s sharp voice spoke again. “Ah, Petya! You and I will settle up in a minute. For now, my brothers, show some love! We have a special guest!”
</p>
<p>
Three men followed Ivan, carrying a rolled-up corduroy rug bound with plastic cord. The cylindrical mass sagged and drooped, defying their efforts to haul it through the doorway.
</p>
<p>
Passinsky realized that the rug itself was squirming and bucking, trying to wriggle out of their grasp.
</p>
<p>
Just inside the doorway, it succeeded. The rolled-up rug hit the floor and emitted a muffled, high-pitched grunt. It writhed on the ground of its own accord, making tiny growling sounds.
</p>
<p>
The men closed the doors and made a circle around the corduroy mass. One reached down and, with a pull of a box-cutter blade, sliced away the plastic cords. It began to unfurl.
</p>
<p>
From the inside of the rolled-up rug crawled a twelve-year-old girl.
</p>
<p>
Rosie Mukhayev’s hands were tied behind her back, and duct tape covered her mouth. She climbed to her feet and spun around, finding herself surrounded by large men.
</p>
<p>
Her first reaction was to choose two of them at random and lunge forward to squeeze her small body quickly through the gap between them.
</p>
<p>
It didn’t work. One man clasped his calloused fingers firmly around her elbows and pulled her back against his torso, holding her in place. She tried going limp to slide out of his grasp, but all it did was twist her shoulder. Futilely, she kicked and body-checked against him, making small, furious noises.
</p>
<p>
The circle of men parted to make way for Ivan as he approached the young girl. He cocked his head, studying her like an eagle eyeing a cornered rabbit. “She’s a feisty one!” He took a step closer and slowly reached out toward her face with a bony, gnarled hand. He traced the back of one hairy knuckle against her soft cheek, slid a jagged fingernail against the gag over her mouth, and yanked the tape from her skin with a loud rip. 
</p>
<p>
A white cotton rag had been stuffed into her mouth. She wiggled her jaw and tongue to push out the saliva-soaked ball, and spit the wad to the floor.
</p>
<p>
And screamed.
</p>
<p>
Her shrill, piercing voice rang out like a steam whistle, slicing through the room like a storm of razors.
</p>
<p>
Ivan merely crossed his arms and laughed. It was a dry, hacking sound.
</p>
<p>
The scream faded to silence. She eyed the middle-aged man with hatred and apprehension as he tittered diabolically at her.
</p>
<p>
“Little angel, do you think anyone can hear you? Look around! Rooms like these are built for rock stars! There’s two meters of soundproofing under this floor. You could throw a dance party with a thousand people, and nobody would hear a thing downstairs. A grenade could go off, and people below would just think we’re watching a movie.”
</p>
<p>
For a few moments she said nothing. Finally, in English, she sneered, “When my Daddy gets here, you are so fucked.”
</p>
<p>
At this, Ivan burst into haughty laughter. “Your ‘Daddy?’ You know what happened last time your ‘Daddy’ tried to dance with me, right?” He leaned forward and jutted his face toward hers. “You don’t know who I am, do you?” His breath smelled of dental work and recently-eaten fish.
</p>
<p>
She spit in his face.
</p>
<p>
He stepped back and wiped the spit away with his sleeve. “Take her upstairs! She’ll need time to, shall we say, fully comprehend her new circumstances. Keep an eye on her tonight. We’ll take her back to St. Petersburg tomorrow. Then we can properly begin her ‘education.’”
</p>
<p>
The thug holding her nodded compliantly, and dragged her bucking, kicking, wriggling body up the wide spiral staircase, until her shouts and barks of protest faded somewhere in the carpeted hallways overhead.
</p>
<p>
When they were gone, Ivan spun to face the living room, and clapped his hands. He flashed Dr. Passinsky a crocodile smile. “Petya! Come over here and join us!” Passinsky approached demurely. “It’s good to see you, Petya! I take it you’ve been able to resolve that little dilemma from this morning?”
</p>
<p>
Passinsky nodded. He reached into his pocket, and produced the small translucent vial.
</p>
<p>
Ivan reached out and took it in his coarse hand. He held the vial in his palm and chuckled, looking eye to eye with the smiley face sticker on its side. “Such a small thing,” he said. “Yet a cause of so much fuss.”
</p>
<p>
“It is the product of years of research,” said Passinsky.
</p>
<p>
“And the cultivation instructions?” Ivan asked.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve emailed you documents on proper incubation procedures and optimal yield formulas,” said Passinsky. “This bacterial strain appears to be particularly hardy and will probably thrive even in poorly calibrated incubation environments.”
</p>
<p>
Ivan smirked. “Thank you, Petya. You have done well.”
</p>
<p>
Passinsky shrugged off the praise. “Have you had a chance to speak with Tungsten’s former creditors?”
</p>
<p>
“What for?” Ivan said casually.
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean, ‘what for?’” Passinsky said, and instantly regretted it. “At the risk of sounding impertinent, sir… I was under the impression that the whole purpose of your visit was to discuss the recent reinstatement of Tungsten’s debts.”
</p>
<p>
Ivan eyed the vial in his hand. “That hardly matters anymore.”
</p>
<p>
“It… doesn’t matter?” Passinsky asked suspiciously.
</p>
<p>
“I have what I need,” Ivan said with a shrug, and placed the vial in his chest pocket.
</p>
<p>
Passinsky felt his blood run cold. “I… I’m afraid I don’t understand. What will happen to Tungsten?”
</p>
<p>
“The hostile takeover will succeed,” Ivan said simply. “Whoever wants this company, they can have it.”
</p>
<p>
“And the equipment? And the staff?” Passinsky repeated, going pale. “And me?”
</p>
<p>
“Auctioned. Disbanded. And…” Ivan gave a wide, uncaring shrug. “Eh.”
</p>
<p>
“We had an agreement!” Passinsky insisted hoarsely.
</p>
<p>
“Did we now?” Ivan said with a smirk.
</p>
<p>
Passinsky’s thin lips curled downward. “Do you think I work for you because I enjoy gazing upon your face?” One look at Ivan’s face, and Passinsky knew he was treading very dangerous ground. He harshly swallowed his bile. “Sir. I didn't mean to be rude. But as a businessman, I’m sure you understand that our arrangement was supposed to further my own interests as well as yours. I have personal theories about the functioning of the brain that I’ve been waiting for <em>decades</em> to put to the test. At the Russian Academy of Sciences, my objectives were continuously sidelined by whatever pseudoscientific fixation captured the Politburo’s momentary attention. In the ’60s, it was Lysenkoism. Polywater in the ’70s. Telekinesis in the ’80s. What they called ‘science’ was puerile politically-driven prostitution! And now, with the Soviet Union dissolved, my sole access to equipment and personnel lies in the private sector &mdash; which, in today’s Russia, means doing business with… gentlemen such as yourself. So, let there be no mistake. I did genuinely find your project to be an intriguing diversion. But my labor for you was contingent on the understanding that, once I completed your R&amp;D goals &mdash; which I have! &mdash; then you would grant me full control of the laboratory with uninterrupted funding for the remainder of my lifetime.”
</p>
<p>
Ivan replied condescendingly, “Well, that’s just it, Petya. It appears that your life simply won’t be all that long.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I expect I have many good years left in me yet,” Passinsky contested. “I’ve maintained a strict nutrition and exercise regimen my entire life, and am in excellent health for a man my age.”
</p>
<p>
“Petya, I’m not referring to your age.”
</p>
<p>
Passinsky felt every muscle in his old body tense. To his side, two of the soldiers came to pick up the corduroy rug. They began smoothing it out on the floor nearby.
</p>
<p>
“I’m referring,” Ivan continued, “to that terribly unfortunate accident you had this afternoon.”
</p>
<p>
The hair on the back of Passinsky’s neck stood on end. He felt the breath of one of the mercenaries standing inches behind him.
</p>
<p>
“You know the accident I mean, yes?” Ivan said. “The one where you fell down the stairs in your house and broke your neck?”
</p>
<p>
Passinsky opened his mouth to offer a response. He never got the chance.
</p>
<p>
A strong hand reached over Passinsky’s shoulder, grabbed his chin, and pulled. Another hand pushed the back of his head in the opposite direction.
</p>
<p>
Passinsky realized bitterly that this would be a serious setback for his research.
