<p>
<span class="caplead">Pyotr Passinsky watched calmly</span> with detached interest as one of the Russian bodyguards blasted another’s skull open with a Dragunov rifle. 
</p>
<p>
“Boom! Headshot!” the sniper cheered. “Three for three!”
</p>
<p>
“Son of a bitch!” yelled the victim, and slammed his PlayStation 3 controller down on the thick glass coffee table. 
</p>
<p>
“Easy, brother!” the assassin said, laughing. “It’s not the table’s fault you suck ass.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh shut the hell up, dick-muncher,” he replied. “I’ve seen you with a real Dragunov. You can’t shoot your way out of a wet paper bag.”
</p>
<p>
Another mercenary excitedly broke away from a heavy petting session with a waifish smoky-eyed whore in one corner of the wide leather couch. He slid over on the sleek cushion and grabbed the now-unmanned controller. “My turn!”
</p>
<p>
Passinsky, for his part, merely gazed bemusedly at the graphics, marveling over the incredible complexity of the machinery required to provide these men their entertainment. 
</p>
<p>
They sat in the deep leather couches of a red-carpeted sunken living room inside the Presidential Suite of the Medina Gallante, a luxurious penthouse built of cedar, marble, and glass. The young men had co-opted the enormous LCD TV hanging on one wall to rowdily challenge each other in a few rounds of <em>Call of Duty</em>. Throughout the suite, a dozen or so brash men in their twenties and thirties lounged and chatted and drank beer and fiddled with loaded handguns. They were kept company by a handful of garishly-dressed women whose bodies looked much younger than their faces.
</p>
<p>
On the coffee table, there sat a large crystal punch-bowl filled with fine white powder. It was freely available to the men to enjoy at their discretion. At the moment, the contents of the bowl were being gently picked at by the hot-pink fingernails of an anorexic young woman with more make-up than clothing. She, too, was there strictly for the men’s enjoyment, provided free of charge as a perk of employment by Ivan Zheleznov.
</p>
<p>
A wide spiral staircase wound upwards through the high ceiling to the bedrooms above. French doors opened out to a balcony overlooking Lake Washington and the Seattle skyline, the city silhouetted in rich hues of orange and pink as the sun slowly set behind the Olympic Mountains.
</p>
<p>
There was a quiet muttering from just outside the room. The men perked their ears. With a press of a button, the video game system went mute.
</p>
<p>
The entrance of the Presidential Suite of the Medina Gallante was a pair of large brown cedar doors, latched with wide curving brass handles. 
</p>
<p>
One of the door handles turned.
</p>
<p>
 In the blink of an eye, every man in the room snapped his full attention to the entryway. Those who were sitting jumped to stand; those who were standing crouched and leaned into attack postures. Prostitutes were unceremoniously thrown aside. Handguns leaped out from holsters and pockets and pointed at the door. Metallic clicks echoed through the room as safeties switched off, hammers cocked, cylinders spun, and slides latched.
</p>
<p>
The door opened by a slight crack amid tense stillness.
</p>
<p>
Through the gap came a rasping, gravelly male voice. “Easy, boys!” it said boisterously. “It’s just me!”
</p>
<p>
At the sound of the voice, handguns lowered and stances relaxed. 
</p>
<p>
The double doors swung open, pushed casually apart by the arms of a cavalier middle-aged man in a three-piece suit. In the entryway stood the silver-haired, beak-nosed, hawk-eyed figure of Ivan Zheleznov.
</p>
<p>
He sauntered confidently into the room, strutting like a king among his loyal peasants. The mercenaries hooted him a few sporadic greetings.
</p>
<p>
Passinsky unfolded his long, gaunt legs in the complicated process of rising from the deep couch. He stood humbly in the sunken living room and greeted Ivan with a deferential nod.
</p>
<p>
Ivan’s sharp, grating voice spoke again. “Ah, Petya! It’s good to see you. You and I will settle up in a minute. For now, my brothers, show some love! We have a special guest!”
</p>
<p>
Three men followed Ivan, carrying a large rolled-up corduroy rug bound with strands of plastic cord. The cylindrical mass sagged and drooped, defying their efforts to haul it through the doorway.
</p>
<p>
Passinsky realized that the rug itself was squirming and bucking, trying to wriggle out of their grasp.
</p>
<p>
Just inside the doorway, it succeeded. The rolled-up rug hit the floor and emitted a soft, muffled, high-pitched grunt. It writhed on the ground of its own accord, making tiny growling sounds.
</p>
<p>
The men closed the doors and made a circle around the bulky motile corduroy mass. One reached down toward it and, with a pull of a box-cutter blade, sliced away the plastic cords binding the rug in its cylindrical shape. It began to unfurl.
</p>
<p>
Out from the inside of the rolled-up rug crawled an exceptionally pretty twelve-year-old girl.
</p>
<p>
Rosie Mukhayev’s hands were tied behind her back with cord, and duct tape covered her mouth. She pitched and rolled her shoulders to pull herself away from the rug, breathing heavily through her nose, desperate to catch her breath. Her frail ribs expanded and contracted freely now that she had extricated her body out of its corduroy confinement. She climbed to her feet and spun around to take stock, finding herself surrounded by large, aggressive men.
</p>
<p>
Her first reaction was to choose two of them at random and lunge angrily forward to try to squeeze her small body quickly through the gap between them.
</p>
<p>
It didn’t work. One man clasped his large calloused fingers firmly around her elbows and pulled her back against his torso, holding her in place. She tried going limp to slide out of his grasp, but all it did was twist her shoulder. Futilely, she kicked and body-checked against him, her voice making small, furious noises.
</p>
<p>
The circle of men parted to make way for Ivan.
</p>
<p>
The middle-aged man approached the young girl. He cocked his head to one side and sized her up, studying her like an eagle tracking a cornered rabbit. A subtle predatory smirk danced on his dry, aged lips. 
</p>
<p>
“She’s a feisty one!” he said approvingly.
</p>
<p>
Rosie stopped struggling and glared at him in rage, trying to cause him pain just with her gaze alone.
</p>
<p>
Ivan continued staring at the girl, his eyes boring through her smooth skin. He took a step closer to her and slowly reached out toward her face with a bony, gnarled hand that smelled like old man’s sweat. Gently, tenderly, in a facsimile of seduction, he traced the back of one hairy knuckle against her soft cheek. “Little girl, there are a few things we need to discuss,” he rasped, and slid a jagged fingernail against the gag over her mouth. “I’m going to take this off of you now. You want me to do that for you, don’t you? I know you do.”
</p>
<p>
Rosie stared hatefully at him.
</p>
<p>
He yanked the tape from her skin with a loud rip. 
</p>
<p>
A white cotton rag had been stuffed into her mouth. She wiggled her jaw and tongue to push out the saliva-soaked ball, and spit the wad to the floor.
</p>
<p>
And screamed.
</p>
<p>
Her shrill, piercing voice rang out like a steam whistle, slicing through the room like a storm of razors. The scream vibrated as her throat shook amidst the current of air rising forth from her small lungs.
</p>
<p>
Ivan merely crossed his arms and laughed. It was a dry, hacking sound.
</p>
<p>
The girl faded to silence and eyed the middle-aged man with hatred and apprehension as he tittered diabolically at her.
</p>
<p>
“Little angel, do you think anyone can hear you?” he said. “Look around, dear! Rooms like these are built for rock stars! There's two meters of soundproofing under this floor. You could throw a party here with a hundred people and booming music, and nobody would hear a thing downstairs. A grenade could go off in here, and people one floor down would just think we're watching a movie.”
</p>
<p>
For a few moments she said nothing. Finally, in English, she sneered, “When my Daddy gets here, you are so fucked.”
</p>
<p>
At this, Ivan burst into haughty laughter. “Your ‘Daddy?’” he said mockingly, repeating the word in English embedded in a stream of Russian. “You know what happened last time your ‘Daddy’ tried to dance with me, right?”
</p>
<p>
Her eyebrow rose involuntarily.
</p>
<p>
He leaned forward and jutted his face toward hers. “You don’t know who I am, do you?” he asked. His breath smelled of dental work and recently-eaten fish.
</p>
<p>
She spit in his face.
</p>
<p>
He slowly stepped back and wiped the spit away with the sleeve of his suit jacket. When his hand came away from his face, it revealed a lusty grin.
</p>
<p>
 “Take her upstairs,” he said to the mercenary holding Rosie, chuckling slightly. “She’ll need a little bit of time to, shall we say, fully comprehend her new circumstances. Keep an eye on her tonight, but don’t touch her. Nobody touch her. Not yet. There is a process to these things, after all, and I want her to first come to the realization that she will not be rescued. We’ll take her back to St. Petersburg tomorrow. Then we can properly begin her ‘education.’”
</p>
<p>
The thug nodded compliantly, and proceeded to push and drag her bucking, kicking, wriggling, slacking body up the wide spiral staircase, until her shouts and barks of protest faded somewhere in the carpeted hallways overhead.
</p>
<p>
When they were gone, Ivan abruptly spun on his heel to face the living room, and clapped his hands.
</p>
<p>
“Now,” he said excitedly, “there is one more matter worth attending to.” He looked at Dr. Passinsky. “Petya! Come over here and join us!”
</p>
<p>
Passinsky was still standing in the sunken living room, doing his best to avoid entanglement in the touchy matter of the Mukhayev girl. He had seen worse things in his day, and knew better than to show any outward reaction. Demurely, he stepped out and approached Ivan and his men by the stairs.
</p>
<p>
“It’s good to see you, Petya!” Ivan said, and flashed Passinsky a wide crocodile smile. “I take it you’ve been able to resolve that little dilemma from this morning?”
</p>
<p>
Passinsky nodded. He reached into his pocket, and produced the small translucent vial.
</p>
<p>
Ivan reached out and took the container of <em>E. coli</em> in his coarse hand. He held it in his palm and chuckled, looking eye to eye with the smiley face on the vial’s side. “Such a small thing,” he said. “Yet a cause of so much fuss.”
</p>
<p>
“It is the product of years of research,” said Passinsky.
</p>
<p>
“And the cultivation instructions?” Ivan asked.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve emailed you documents on proper incubation procedure and optimal yield formulas,” said Passinsky. “It’s worth noting that this bacterial strain appears to be particularly hardy and will probably thrive even in poorly calibrated incubation environments. Protocol usually demands that you carry it on ice, but by now the mother colony has been out of cold storage for almost twenty-four hours and shows no signs of plasmid instability.”
</p>
<p>
Ivan smirked. “Thank you, Petya. You have done well.”
</p>
<p>
Passinsky shrugged off the praise. “Have you had a chance to speak with Tungsten’s former creditors?”
</p>
<p>
“What for?” Ivan said casually.
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean, ‘what for?’” Passinsky said, and instantly regretted it. “At the risk of sounding impertinent, sir… I was under the impression that the whole purpose of your visit was to meet with me to discuss the recent reinstatement of Tungsten’s debts.”
</p>
<p>
Ivan eyed the vial in his hand. “That hardly matters anymore.”
</p>
<p>
“It… doesn’t matter?” Passinsky asked suspiciously.
</p>
<p>
“I have what I need,” Ivan said with a shrug, and placed the vial in the pocket of his three-piece suit.
</p>
<p>
Passinsky felt his blood run cold. “I… I’m afraid I don’t understand. What will happen to Tungsten?”
</p>
<p>
“The hostile takeover will succeed,” Ivan said simply. “Whoever wants this company, they can have it.”
</p>
<p>
“And the equipment? And the staff?” Passinsky repeated, going pale. “And me?”
</p>
<p>
“Auctioned. Disbanded. And…” Ivan gave a wide, uncaring shrug. “Eh.”
</p>
<p>
“We had an agreement!” Passinsky insisted hoarsely.
</p>
<p>
“Did we now?” Ivan said with a smirk.
</p>
<p>
Passinsky’s thin lips curled downward. “Do you think I work for you because I enjoy gazing upon your face?”
</p>
<p>
Ivan stared sinisterly at the gaunt old man. “Careful, Petya. I’m sure you wouldn’t want to say something you’d regret.”
</p>
<p>
Passinsky harshly swallowed his bile. “Sir. I didn't mean to be rude. But as a businessman, I’m sure you understand that the purpose of our arrangement was to further my own interests as well as yours. I have personal theories about the functioning of the brain that I’ve been waiting for decades &mdash; literally, decades &mdash; to put to the test. Do you think I was permitted to perform real research at the Russian Academy of Sciences? That entire corrupt institution was nothing but a Politburo propaganda toy! Do you know what I was made to study in my years there? Lysenkoism in the ‘60s. Polywater in the ‘70s. Telekinesis in the ‘80s. What they called ‘science’ was puerile politically-driven prostitution! And now, with the Soviet Union dissolved, my situation is no better. My sole opportunity for accessing the kind of equipment and personnel I need lies in the private sector &mdash; which, in today’s Russia, means doing business with… gentlemen such as yourself. So, Ivan, sir, let there be no mistake. I did genuinely find your project to be an intriguing and delightful little, um, diversion. But my labor for you was contingent on the understanding that, once I completed your research and development goals &mdash; which I have! &mdash; then you would grant me full creative control of the laboratory, complete with equipment, facilities, and personnel, with uninterrupted funding for the full remainder of my lifetime.”
</p>
<p>
Ivan, with a shark-like smirk slowly spreading his lips, replied, “Well, that’s just it, Petya. It appears that your life simply won’t be all that long.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I expect I have many good years left in me yet,” Passinsky contested. “I’ve maintained a strict nutrition and exercise regimen my entire life, and am in excellent health for a man my age.”
</p>
<p>
Ivan clucked condescendingly. “Petya, I’m not referring to your age.”
</p>
<p>
Passinsky felt every old muscle in his body tense. “Then what are you referring to?”
</p>
<p>
To his side, two of the soldiers came to pick up the corduroy rug. They began smoothing it out on the floor nearby.
</p>
<p>
“I’m referring,” said Ivan, “to that terribly unfortunate accident you had this afternoon.”
</p>
<p>
The hair on the back of Passinsky’s neck stood on end. He felt the breath of one of the mercenaries standing inches behind him.
</p>
<p>
“You know the accident I mean, yes?” Ivan said. “The one where you fell down the stairs in your house and broke your neck? Your old bones are awfully frail, after all…”
</p>
<p>
Passinsky opened his mouth to offer a response. He never got the chance.
</p>
<p>
A strong hand reached over Passinsky’s shoulder, grabbed his chin, and pulled. Another hand pushed the back of his head in the opposite direction, forcing the spine at the base of his skull to absorb far more torque than it was structurally capable of sustaining.
</p>
<p>
He realized bitterly that this would be a serious setback for his research.
