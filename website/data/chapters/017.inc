“Thanks a lot, jerk,”</span> Danny muttered as they stepped down the interior stairs. “Asperger’s? You told the guy I had Asperger’s?”
</p>
<p>
Jason shrugged. “The best lies are based on truth.”
</p>
<p>
The office catwalk was propped on unpainted I-beams above the factory floor. In the space beneath it lay a naked mattress with a few blankets. An adjacent wall bore large metal double doors.
</p>
<p>
Julie Yen eyed them apprehensively.
</p>
<p>
“Julie,” Jason said from across the room. “Are you okay?”
</p>
<p>
“What do you want?” she grumbled.
</p>
<p>
“Relax,” said Jason. “We’re friends. We won’t hurt you.” He traversed the packing peanuts and torn cardboard littering the floor.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve heard that a lot lately,” she said. Her voice was slow, sad, and tired.
</p>
<p>
Following Jason, Danny stepped over hoses and electrical cables that snaked underneath the mess. He stopped frequently to examine the fascinating equipment around him.
</p>
<p>
In the center of the room was a cylindrical glass vat. It was about two feet tall, and sat atop a waist-high base covered with dials and buttons bearing readouts for temperature, pressure, salinity, and pH. Along its side was a complex system of pipes, hoses, and valves. It looked as though an office water cooler and a cappuccino machine had a baby, and that baby grew up aboard a nuclear submarine. The water inside was hazy and silty like ocean brine. 
</p>
<p>
Near the vat sat a pyramidal stack of plastic gallon-sized jars, just like the powdered diet supplements from the Rite-Aid earlier that night. Each one had a purple label reading “L-Glutamine”.
</p>
<p>
The back wall was lined with blue and black 55-gallon drums, alongside pumping equipment and large plastic tubs. Each barrel bore the label “Kerosene” or “Acetone,” and a color-coded diamond of red, blue, yellow, and white to indicate hazard ratings.
</p>
<p>
On a large gray metal table next to the drums, sitting alone near bulbous glass equipment, was a plain glass bottle filled with clear liquid. Its top was curved like a bell, and its neck was sealed with a rubber-lined glass stopper. Next to the bottle, on the silvery steel tabletop, lay black rubber gloves and a pair of eye goggles. The bottle bore no label.
</p>
<p>
Danny reached his hand toward it.
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t touch that if I were you,” Julie called out.
</p>
<p>
Danny shook the sleeve of Natalie’s floral-print sweatshirt down so that it drooped over his hand, and tried again.
</p>
<p>
Julie scoffed, “Yeah, like that’ll help.”
</p>
<p>
“Why? What is it?” Danny asked.
</p>
<p>
“Hydrochloric acid, eleven molar concentration,” she answered. “I told you idiots you only need three molar to stabilize the base. I’ll have to dilute the shit out of it.” She sighed. “Don’t know why I’m even stopping you. Go ahead, open it. Assholes.”
</p>
<p>
Jason whispered, “We’re not with the Russians.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?” Julie asked suspiciously.
</p>
<p>
“Do you want to get out of here?” Jason added.
</p>
<p>
Julie’s lower lip trembled. “I want…” she scowled up at the dim windows of the overhead office and screamed, “…my <em>fucking blow</em>!” She grabbed a nearby piece of cardboard and threw it weakly upwards. It didn’t get very far through the air. “You assholes! You fucking shitheads! It’s the best shit they’ve ever seen, and they fucking stole it! It’s mine, God fucking damn it! Fuck…!” She stomped back toward her mattress, dropped down to sit, wrapped her arms around her knees and began to sob.
</p>
<p>
Rex’s head popped out through the window above. “Knock it off down there, sweetie pie! Numbers, if she gives you crap like that, just smack her in the mouth. She learns quick.” The man’s dirty blond head disappeared back into the office.
</p>
<p>
Jason squatted down next to her and said, “It’ll be okay. I brought something that might cheer you up.” He stretched his hand out, and for a moment her eyes grew bright and eager.
</p>
<p>
When she saw him present the Eppendorf tube, she looked away uninterested.
</p>
<p>
Jason seemed confused. “I kind of thought you’d be happy to see it.”
</p>
<p>
She turned away and moaned, “I’m such a fuck-up.”
</p>
<p>
Jason studied her for a moment. “What’s the matter?”
</p>
<p>
“This is all my fault,” she said, her speech trembling. “I should have just fucking done my job and finished my internship like a good little girl. The fuck was I thinking, that I could pull this off? I can’t fucking do anything right.”
</p>
<p>
Jason gave her a kind smile. “You know, you’d probably get along with my friend over there. He gets really down on himself too.”
</p>
<p>
“He should start doing coke,” she suggested. Her voice conveyed no hint of jest. She added absentmindedly, “He’s gonna burn his hands off, by the way.”
</p>
<p>
Jason turned his head and saw Danny still by the metal table. “Danny, what the hell are you doing?”
</p>
<p>
Danny was still examining the glass bottle, poking it with the end of his HERF gun to make the clear liquid jiggle. It looked for all the world like perfectly normal water, but a very fine white haze hung suspended inside the bottle above the waterline.
</p>
<p>
Julie shuffled toward him, looking irritated. Danny put his contraption down and backed away from the table.
</p>
<p>
Without a word, Julie pulled on the black rubber gloves and strapped the goggles over her face. Holding the bottle with one hand, she gently pulled out the stopper. Like mist rising from a freshly opened ice-cold beer, a translucent trail of pale vapor wafted upward. She reached down and grabbed a scrap of brown cardboard from the floor. She slowly waved the cardboard over the bottle, letting it pass through the finger of mist. Along the line of exposure, the cardboard blackened and charred before Danny’s eyes. She gave the sheet a slight shake, and chunks of the cardboard crumbled to ash onto the floor. Julie used the remains of the cardboard to wipe the rubber stopper. Where it touched, the cardboard simply vanished. A trace of gray smoke rose briefly, accompanied by a very faint hissing noise.
</p>
<p>
Julie reinserted the stopper into the bottle, and turned to Danny. “That’s why you don’t fuck with this stuff!” she said as she took the gloves and goggles back off. “Got it?”
</p>
<p>
Jason approached them, carefully making his way past the equipment. “What’s all this stuff for?” he asked the girl, gesturing at the blue barrels of kerosene.
</p>
<p>
“It’s high-volume alkaloid extraction and stabilization,” Julie said, annoyed. “I’ve already explained it a hundred times…” In a lackluster tone, she asked, “Can I see the sample?”
</p>
<p>
Jason cautiously passed the Eppendorf tube into her hand.
</p>
<p>
She studied it, turning the vial up and down several times and holding it up to her eyes. “It’s biofilming,” she said. “That’s good. It’s supposed to.”
</p>
<p>
“Can you incubate it?” asked Jason.
</p>
<p>
“You’d like that, wouldn’t you?” said Julie. “Everybody would. And then the second I finish a batch, the Russians will just take it all and put a bullet through my head.”
</p>
<p>
“I might be able to talk them into letting you go,” Jason offered.
</p>
<p>
“Fat chance,” Julie said despondently.
</p>
<p>
“It’s worth a try,” said Jason. “But I want you to tell me more about it first.”
</p>
<p>
Julie frowned. “Can you maybe at least get me some blow?”
</p>
<p>
“Tell me what’s in the vial,” said Jason, “and I’ll see what I can do about your drugs.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s a cocaine factory,” she said simply.
</p>
<p>
Jason looked around. “Yeah, I kind of gathered that.”
</p>
<p>
Julie held up the vial. “No, this. <em>This</em> is a cocaine factory.”
</p>
<p>
Jason blinked. “How do you mean?”
</p>
<p>
Julie pointed to the pyramid of large plastic jars near the cylindrical vat in the middle of the room. “You see those buckets of glutamine? You feed them that stuff, and they poop out benzoylmethylecgonine.”
</p>
<p>
“Benzowhat?” said Jason.
</p>
<p>
“Cocaine,” Julie clarified. “Benzoylmethylecgonine. The world’s best targeted dopamine reuptake inhibitor.”
</p>
<p>
Jason remained expressionless. “That L-Glutamine stuff…” he said, eyeing the purple labels on the jars. “Is it hard to get?”
</p>
<p>
Julie looked at Jason with a face usually directed at the kid in class who eats his paste. “It’s <em>glutamine</em>. It’s forty bucks a pound at any GNC store. Even cheaper if you buy in bulk. And it converts to cocaine at almost 100% yield by mole. So you’re basically making cocaine at ninety bucks a kilo.”
</p>
<p>
Jason let a smile break through his poker face. “So, you incubate the germs in that vial, then you pour in that glutamine stuff, and then suddenly you have cocaine?”
</p>
<p>
“More or less,” said Julie, her voice tired and morose. “I mean, there’s a little more to it. You have to give it time to let the enzymes act on the glutamine, but after that you can process it just like leaves from a coca plant. Mix it with kerosene, grind it into a paste, separate with acetone, blah blah blah. The process kills the bacteria, so you need to keep a pure mother broth around. But in a nutshell, yeah.”
</p>
<p>
Danny listened on, partially fascinated and partially shocked. “Wait, let me get this straight. This whole night, this whole hacking mission, I’ve been chasing after some kind of germ that’s been injected with the gene for cocaine?”
</p>
<p>
“There is no ‘gene for cocaine’. Cocaine isn’t a protein,” she said condescendingly. “It’s a crystalline tropane alkaloid. Do you have any idea how complicated its biosynthesis process is?”
</p>
<p>
“Umm… no?” Danny replied.
</p>
<p>
“Look, cellular machinery can’t create cocaine through normal gene expression,” said Julie. “But cellular machinery <em>can</em> create enzymes to catalyze the conversion of precursors &mdash; in this case, glutamine. That’s what happens in the <em>Erythroxylon coca</em> &mdash; the coca plant. There’s about sixteen steps in the natural biosynthesis of the benzoylmethylecgonine tropane alkaloid. Those steps are catalyzed by about two dozen enzymes, six of which consist of multiple peptide chains and two of which are themselves synthesized by other enzymes… The point is, unlike cocaine, enzymes <em>are</em> proteins. Enzymes <em>do</em> have genetic encodings. Which means…”
</p>
<p>
She left the pause pregnant, hoping that the implication would be obvious. Instead, the two men stared at her blankly.
</p>
<p>
Julie rolled her eyes. “…Which means that we can sequence those genes in the coca plant, and then splice them into a strain of <em>E. coli</em> for mass production. So the <em>E. coli</em> thinks they’re part of its own genome, and manufactures them as if they’re part of its normal repertoire of proteins. Got it?”
</p>
<p>
Danny nodded brightly. “Yeah!”
</p>
<p>
Julie eyed him skeptically. “You don’t get it, do you?”
</p>
<p>
“No, I do!” Danny declared gleefully. “It’s just like a DLL hijacking attack!”
</p>
<p>
Julie stared at him.
</p>
<p>
“It’s how a lot of computer viruses work,” Danny explained. “They copy a virus-riddled file into a specific place somewhere on your filesystem, so that the computer thinks that the file is a normal part of some application. When you run that application, the computer runs the virus along with the rest of the application’s code.” 
</p>
<p>
Jason stared at the girl with a combative expression. “So, you successfully gene-spliced a coca plant into a laboratory germ in order to create a cocaine-producing bio-machine.”
</p>
<p>
“Yeah,” Julie said proudly.
</p>
<p>
“That sounds like one hell of an engineering accomplishment,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“Recombinant genetics isn’t for sissies,” she replied flatly.
</p>
<p>
“So,” Jason asked, “how much of this genetic engineering did you perform on your own?”
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?” Julie replied.
</p>
<p>
“How did <em>you</em> get that vial?” Jason prodded.
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean, how did I get it?” Julie said, a hint of anger adding a spark to her voice. “I just told you! It’s made from sequencing the <em>Erythroxylon coca</em> genome, taking all the genes of the entire metabolic pathway…”
</p>
<p>
“That doesn’t answer the question,” said Jason.
</p>
<p>
“I think it does,” Julie said defensively.
</p>
<p>
“It answers how <em>Tungsten</em> created it,” said Jason. “It doesn’t answer how <em>you</em> ended up with it. Look, I don’t know much about science, but I do know plenty about manpower and personnel management. The kind of engineering effort you’re describing would take years, even for a team of world-class researchers. You did <em>not</em> create it on your own as some intern summer project.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m a key member of the research staff!” Julie said defiantly.
</p>
<p>
“You’re a college sophomore,” Jason retorted.
</p>
<p>
“They couldn’t have finished it without me!” she protested.
</p>
<p>
“Right. They needed <em>you</em> to sequence the coca plant genome,” Jason said sardonically. “They needed <em>you</em> to splice the genes into the <em>E. coli</em> strain. They needed <em>you</em> to figure out how to cultivate and process it.”
</p>
<p>
“God, shut the fuck up!” Julie yelled, her lip quivering. She stormed back to the naked mattress beneath the overhanging office, where she sat back down in a huff. “You don’t even know, alright?”
</p>
<p>
“So tell me, then,” Jason coaxed. “Tell me how it all went down.”
</p>
<p>
Julie looked down wistfully and picked idly at a loose thread in the mattress. “Everything sucks,” she said quietly.
</p>
<p>
Jason sat down beside her. 
</p>
<p>
The girl sighed. “Creating cocaine-producing <em>E. coli</em> wasn’t just some side-project. It’s the whole point of Tungsten. It’s all they’ve been doing for about two years. This vial is everything they’ve been working for.”
</p>
<p>
“And they entrusted it to their intern?” asked Jason.
</p>
<p>
“They didn’t know I had it until it was too late,” said Julie.
</p>
<p>
Jason waited patiently for her to continue.
</p>
<p>
“Genetic engineering isn’t an exact science,” she explained. “It’s not like we can reach inside the nucleus of a coca plant with tiny little tweezers and pull out a specific DNA strand. Getting a gene from one organism into another is a very messy process, and it only goes right a tiny fraction of the time. It’s a lot of trial and error. We use special chemicals called restriction enzymes to chop out the genes we want from the source organism. Each different restriction enzyme binds to one specific DNA sequence and cuts the DNA strand there. So, if we’ve sequenced a gene, then we can pick a restriction enzyme that binds to the beginning of the gene and another that binds to the end, and then we mix them with the DNA. And, assuming we were right, the gene floats right out into the solution. But a lot of other unwanted chunks of DNA also float out along with it, because there’s inevitably going to be other places in the genome that the restriction enzymes lock onto. Once you’ve gotten these chunks of DNA from the coca plant, you then have to fool an <em>E. coli</em> bacterium into absorbing them into its own genome. It’s tricky because bacteria have evolved restriction modification systems to protect themselves from foreign DNA…”
</p>
<p>
Danny interrupted her excitedly. “Ooh! Just like Intrusion Prevention Systems on computer networks! I just learned about those today. The hard way.”
</p>
<p>
Julie blinked at him and shrugged dismissively. “Anyway. So, you have to fool a bacterium into taking in your new chunk of DNA as its own,” she continued. “You have to wrap the new gene into a plasmid, or load it into a bacteriophage virus, and so on. Oh, <em>and</em> you have to give the <em>E. coli</em> that <em>do</em> absorb your new gene some kind of survival advantage over ones that don’t &mdash; that’s usually done by something called a ‘selectable marker’, which is where we intentionally throw in a gene that makes the bacteria resistant to some kind of antibiotic. Or a ‘screenable marker’ which is where we add a gene for bioluminescence to make the desired bacteria glow in the dark. Because, don’t forget, the whole time we’re doing all this, we don’t actually <em>see</em> what we’re working with &mdash; all we’re doing is dripping vials of clear liquid into other vials of clear liquid and then adding brown goop to the mix and keeping our fingers crossed.”
</p>
<p>
“So, what you’re saying,” said Jason, “is that it’s very hit-or-miss work. You can do everything right, and in the end it could turn out that your germs didn’t absorb any new DNA. Or they did absorb some new DNA, but it wasn’t the DNA you were hoping for &mdash; it was some unwanted junk DNA instead.”
</p>
<p>
“Right,” said Julie. “Or they got the right DNA and inserted it into their genome successfully, but put it somewhere in the genome where it can’t be expressed &mdash; where the transcription and translation systems can’t find it, so it can’t make new proteins.”
</p>
<p>
“Which means you have to mix up another batch and try again, right?” said Jason.
</p>
<p>
“Over and over,” said Julie. “And that’s just for <em>one</em> gene. The metabolic pathway for cocaine synthesis has about forty.”
</p>
<p>
“Sounds very repetitive,” said Jason.
</p>
<p>
“It’s mostly done by robots,” said Julie. “But you always have to follow up with more tests by hand.”
</p>
<p>
Jason smiled. “Yes. I get it now. That’s exactly the kind of task… that they’d give an intern. So the scientists ran hundreds of thousands of these batches… and you were the first one to spot a success.”
</p>
<p>
Julie nodded. “It was my job to check on them. The other scientists couldn’t be bothered with something so mundane. So, yeah, when one of the batches finally produced an <em>E. coli</em> strain that was expressing all the genes in the cocaine biosynthesis pathway, I was the first to see it.”
</p>
<p>
“And you were supposed to call in the senior researchers,” Jason surmised. “But instead, you…”
</p>
<p>
“Yeah,” said Julie. “I just… you know…”
</p>
<p>
“Took it.”
</p>
<p>
Julie nodded. “They started to realize that something was out of place. Damned if I know how. Sensor data from the robot, maybe? Anyway, they didn’t call me out on it. They were just starting to suspect me after a couple weeks. But by then I’d already started making my own batches and dealing. And then I found out that I was on Sergey’s turf… And the rest of the story is…”
</p>
<p>
Jason looked around the room, at the naked mattress and the unwashed, pajama-clad girl. “Yeah.”
</p>
<p>
Julie let herself roll backward onto the mattress. She turned her face away from Jason and curled up on her side into a fetal position, the Eppendorf tube held between the palms of her small hands.
</p>
<p>
Jason watched her in silence. Danny, for his part, wandered over to the vat in the middle of the room to examine its elaborate plumbing systems. 
</p>
<p>
Quietly, Jason asked her, “Are you okay?”
</p>
<p>
“No!” she answered. “No, I’m not fucking okay! God, I don’t understand why everything has to be so fucking hard!” She began to sob. “Nothing I do ever fucking works! Nothing is ever good enough! I get a full scholarship to the University of Washington and my parents are like, ‘Why not Berkeley or MIT?’ I score 97% on my organic chemistry final and break the curve, and they go, ‘How could you miss those three percent?’ I work so fucking hard, just to feel the slightest shred of pride and accomplishment, and all I ever get is disappointment. All I want is just to be able to enjoy the feeling of knowing that I did <em>something</em> right for once in my life. <em>Anything</em>. I figured all I needed was one big score, just do one single goddamned thing, so I could show everybody that I can measure up. Just to prove to the world, ‘Look at me, fuckers! I win! I don’t care what you say! I <em>am</em> good enough!’ Except… Except I’m obviously not.”
</p>
<p>
Jason reached out to pat her reassuringly on the shoulder. 
</p>
<p>
Her voice thin, she asked, “Can you please get me some coke now?”
</p>
<p>
He paused, and said, “Okay, Julie. I’ll see what I can do.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you,” she whimpered, still not moving from her fetal position.
</p>
<p>
“But first, I want you to explain one more thing to me.”
</p>
<p>
She sat back up and shot him a furious glare. “Oh fuck, come on! I’ve told you everything! What the hell else do you want to know?”
</p>
<p>
“You’ve told me the how, but not the why. You said Tungsten was working full-time to develop this organic cocaine dispenser. But why would they do that? From a business perspective, that doesn’t make any sense. The end product is illegal to sell. What was Tungsten’s market strategy?”
</p>
<p>
“You mean like how to make money off of it?” asked Julie. “Fuck if I know. I was just on the science end of things. Who cares, anyway?”
</p>
<p>
“Me,” said Jason flatly. “I care. I care a lot.”
</p>
<p>
“All I know are rumors,” she said. “If I tell them to you, will you go get me some coke already?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Jason.
</p>
<p>
“Promise?” she insisted.
</p>
<p>
“Pinky-swear.”
</p>
<p>
“Fine,” she grumbled. “The thing is, Doctor P. never talked about it, but the other scientists had some ideas. They believe the future of psychopharmacology is dopamine.”
</p>
<p>
“Dopamine?” asked Jason.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a neurotransmitter &mdash; a chemical in your brain,” said Julie. “It’s the main hormone found in a part of the brain called the nucleus accumbens, the ‘pleasure center’ or ‘reward center’. Dopamine also runs a shitload of other stuff in your brain, but we figure the reward pathway is sort of the key to it all.”
</p>
<p>
“How’s it connected to cocaine?” asked Jason.
</p>
<p>
“Cocaine is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor,” she said. “You’ve heard of SSRIs, right? Selective <em>serotonin</em> reuptake inhibitors? Like Lexapro, Zoloft, Paxil, that kind of thing?”
</p>
<p>
“I’ve heard the term,” said Jason. “Antidepressants?”
</p>
<p>
“Right,” said Julie. “See, the pharmaceutical industry’s gotten pretty good at managing this one brain hormone called serotonin. Basically, increasing the amount of serotonin in certain parts of the brain makes people feel calmer and more mellow; if someone is chronically stressed or depressed, that correlates to low serotonin levels. In the 1950s, research chemists at a French company called Rhône-Poulenc were working on antihistamines, and instead they accidentally stumbled onto a class of drugs called tricyclics. Turned out that tricyclics jam up the brain’s serotonin-draining machinery. Brain cells work by squirting neurotransmitters at each other through an intracellular gap called a synapse. After each neural impulse, the presynaptic neuron sucks back up all the hormone it just squirted &mdash; if it didn’t do that, then the hormone would stay hanging around in the synaptic cleft, and the postsynaptic cell wouldn’t be able to tell when one burst stops and the next begins. Anyway, these tricyclic chemicals happen to be shaped, on a molecular level, just barely enough like serotonin to fit into the reuptake pump &mdash; but not enough to pass all the way through it. So the presynaptic neuron sucks up a tricyclic molecule thinking it’s serotonin, and the tricyclic gets stuck in the pump. So the presynaptic neuron can’t suck up any more serotonin because its pumps are jammed, and the serotonin ends up just sort of pooling in the synapse and triggering the postsynaptic neuron over and over like one long giant continuous activation spike. The end result is a major increase in serotonergic activity.”
</p>
<p>
“Okay, but what does that have to do with cocaine?” said Jason. “Cocaine <em>isn’t</em> an SSRI, right? You said cocaine works on…”
</p>
<p>
“Dopamine,” said Julie. “There’s a relatively new class of drugs called <em>D</em>RIs &mdash; <em>dopamine</em> reuptake inhibitors. They were created by researchers who saw what tricyclics did with serotonin and were like, ‘Hey, let’s pull off the same trick with dopamine!’ Dopamine is what the brain’s reward centers run on. So while modulating serotonin would simply make people feel calm, modulating <em>dopamine</em> could drastically change people’s behavioral motivators. That’s how you get things on the market now like Wellbutrin and Ritalin and Adderall.”
</p>
<p>
“And cocaine?” Jason tried.
</p>
<p>
“Cocaine is the granddaddy of them all,” said Julie. “Cocaine is the <em>original</em> DRI. What all these modern DRIs do artificially, the coca plant’s been doing naturally for millions of years. Cocaine screws directly with the reward pathway. Like, if you ace a test at school, the bolt of satisfaction you feel when you see that big red A+ in the corner is the stimulation of the reward pathway, telling you you’re awesome and that you’re good at this shit. If you’re playing a sport and you score a point and you feel the rush of power and the thrill of victory, that’s your reward pathway lighting up at full blast. And when the reward pathway activates, it sensitizes neural channels that correspond to whatever you’re doing at the time &mdash; it makes you more likely to make the decision to do it again. So the dopamine rush you feel when you ace a test makes you more likely to choose to study in the future, so you can feel it again; when you score a goal, it makes you willing to practice more. It’s the positive feedback system that makes the cognitive machinery of the brain do more of what works and less of what doesn’t.”
</p>
<p>
Jason nodded. “And cocaine throws this reward system into overdrive.”
</p>
<p>
“Exactly,” Julie said. “The reward pathway runs on dopamine. Cocaine prevents the neurons in the pathway from cleaning up after themselves, so there’s dopamine overflowing everywhere.”
</p>
<p>
“Which, like acing a test or scoring a goal, inclines the cocaine user to do more of whatever the heck they were doing to make that happen…” said Jason.
</p>
<p>
“…Which happens to be just snorting lines of coke,” concluded Julie.
</p>
<p>
Jason nodded soberly. “Sounds like a vicious cycle.”
</p>
<p>
Julie looked up at him. She tried to smile, but the corners of her mouth twitched downward. “They do say the stuff’s addictive.”
</p>
<p>
“So how do these new dopamine-based medicines heal rather than harm?” said Jason.
</p>
<p>
“There’s some emerging theories that tweaking the reward pathways can help treat a wide variety of cognitive and psychological problems,” said Julie. “Like, a lot of DRIs are used to manage Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Nobody really knows why they work on ADHD, but one theory says that classroom hyperactivity is just the natural action of a child’s brain searching their environment for a ‘fix’. They’re also used for Social Anxiety Disorder, to help people who feel awkward or uncomfortable around other people &mdash; the idea there is that their reward pathway doesn’t get enough stimulation from personal interaction. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.”
</p>
<p>
“So what you’re saying is, there’s a lot of potential market applications for this new class of vaguely cocaine-like medicines, just waiting to be explored,” Jason said.
</p>
<p>
“Yeah. There’s a lot of people that dopamine reuptake inhibitors can help,” said Julie.
</p>
<p>
“Like who?” Jason asked.
</p>
<p>
“Like, people who are a little bit ‘off’, in a bunch of different ways,” Julie answered. “Basically, anybody that’s obsessively goal-oriented, or neurotic, or socially awkward, or prone to drifting off into daydreams and living in La-La Land.”
</p>
<p>
Jason smiled and said, “Oh, really…?” His head slowly swiveled to look at Danny.
</p>
<p>
Danny was crouching next to the cylindrical vat, gazing at the cloudy water. 
</p>
<p>
“Periscope down, ensign!” Danny said to nobody in particular. “Helmsman, begin descent!” He pushed down on a protrusion, announcing, “Aye aye, captain!” He reached an arm around to the other side of the cylindrical water tank, and made kicking motions with two fingers. “Dive team! Dive team, do you copy?” Placing his other hand partly over his mouth, he made heavy breathing noises, reporting between breaths, “Aye, captain! No sign of the treasure yet…!”
</p>
<p>
Jason wordlessly brought his palm to his face and shook his head.
</p>
<p>
Julie batted at Jason’s shoulder. “So, we had a deal…”
</p>
<p>
Jason sighed. “Yeah. Your drugs,” he said, and with a grunt he stood up. “I’ll go talk to that Rex guy upstairs.” He looked down at the girl sitting on the mattress with her arms around her knees. “Thank you, Julie. You’ve been… helpful.”
</p>

<div class="chapsection">
<p>
<span class="caplead">Captain Danny was guiding his submarine</span> through the treacherous Vat Sea when his crew encountered an enormous sea monster. From Captain Danny’s perspective, the creature looked like a horizontally stretched human face, almost like that of a young Asian female as seen through the lens-warping effect of a water-filled cylinder.
</p>
<p>
“Do you mind?” said the aquatic beast through its overly large mouth. “I set the environment for optimal growth conditions. It’d be nice if you didn’t screw it up.”
</p>
<p>
Danny stood up and looked at Julie over the vat. She regained normal human proportions. “Sorry. It’s been a seriously crazy day. I could really use some sleep.”
</p>
<p>
“Heh, I know something white and powdery that can fix that,” she said with a conspiratorial smirk.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t do drugs,” Danny asserted. “I hate the idea of fucking with my brain.”
</p>
<p>
Julie laughed at him. “You fuck with your brain all the time and you don’t even know it. Amino acids in your food get metabolized into neurotransmitters, and carbohydrates affect your cortisol levels. So does exercise, which also releases endorphins. And you breathe air, right? Do you know what different oxygen concentrations do to your neurochemistry? Or sunlight, which triggers your body to make melanin and vitamin D, which have mood-altering effects. You spend time outside in the sun, right?” She looked him over. “Okay, bad example.”
</p>
<p>
“Yeah, but that’s all natural,” said Danny.
</p>
<p>
“So’s cocaine,” Julie replied. “It comes from a plant. Plants are natural.”
</p>
<p>
Danny pointed to the barrels of chemicals at the back of the room. “Natural? You use <em>that</em> to extract it into a powder.”
</p>
<p>
“You cook your food, don’t you?” the girl retorted.
</p>
<p>
“Me? I usually just microwave stuff that comes out of my freezer.”
</p>
<p>
“Real natural, homeboy,” Julie teased. “Besides, the very concept of agriculture itself &mdash; controlling your own food supply by intentionally raising plants and animals for the express purpose of eating them. <em>That’s</em> natural? Not to mention selectively breeding the fattest cows, the juiciest apples, and the hardiest grains for the last twenty thousand years. People get all cranky about genetically modified organisms, as if we haven’t been genetically modifying things since the Neolithic Revolution.”
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t there a difference of degree?” Danny said. “I mean, isn’t there a line somewhere between growing your own plants on a farm, and directly manipulating the genome of a laboratory bacterium?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think there is,” said Julie. “Look, every single organism on Earth alters the world around it in order to increase its own survivability. It’s part of the <em>definition</em> of life. Exploiting and manipulating other organisms is fair play. The game of life has no rules. Every living thing tries to win by tilting the playing field to its favor. Humans just happen to be very, very good at it. Beavers make dams and bees make hives. Humans make cities and airplanes and pesticides. Controlling nature <em>is</em> our nature &mdash; it’s what we’ve evolved to be good at. Like everything else on this planet, we change the world in our own image. That’s how living things live. That’s how life works.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you mean that in a biochemical sense, or a philosophical one?” Danny asked.
</p>
<p>
Julie grinned at him. “Is there a difference?”
</p>
<p>
Above them, the office door opened. Down the stairs came two pairs of footsteps.
</p>
<p>
Jason descended toward the factory floor. Rex closely followed with gun in hand, his long ragged blond hair and pocked skin looking terrible under the bright gymnasium-style lights overhead.
</p>
<p>
When they reached the bottom of the stairs, they shuffled through the cardboard and packing peanuts toward the table at the back of the room, near the barrels of solvents. 
</p>
<p>
Julie kept her eyes fixed on the two of them. “Well?” she insisted.
</p>
<p>
Rex sat down on the folding chair. He put his gun across his lap, produced something from his pocket, and hunched over the tabletop. Danny could hear faint, quick tapping noises on the table’s metal surface.
</p>
<p>
Julie’s face lit up in an ecstatic grin. Her eyes and mouth went wide, and she drew in a quick breath of unbearable anticipation. With her small body and her oversized pajamas, she looked like a child beaming at the sight of a stack of presents under the tree on a wintry white Christmas morning. But in her case, the only present &mdash; the greatest present of all &mdash; was the snow. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="chapsection">
<p>
<span class="caplead">Julie threw her arms around Jason,</span> squealing, “Thank you! Thank you!” Jason grimly accepted the gratitude for a few moments before pushing her away.
</p>
<p>
On the tabletop, Rex had cleared himself some room to work, pushing some glassware aside. The clear unlabeled bottle sat on one side of the table, next to the goggles and the black rubber gloves.
</p>
<p>
Rex hunched over the table, upon which sat a crumpled square of Saran wrap a few inches on each side. In the middle of the plastic wrap lay a tightly packed pile of white powder. Rex had poured some of the powder out onto the table, and was using a razor blade to carefully chop it into finer granules and draw it out into lines. The razor blade made quick tap-tap-taps, punctuated by smooth slicing sounds as he dragged the drug into long, straight parallel rails.
</p>
<p>
“You got any idea how much trouble I’d be in if the boss-man found out?” the scruffy blond man grumbled as he worked. “We’re in lockdown. I was supposed to flush this.”
</p>
<p>
Julie stared transfixed at the thin white lines as they materialized underneath the razorblade. Her expression bore the eagerness of Pavlov’s dogs upon hearing a bell.
</p>
<p>
“Can I do that?” she pleaded, leaning lustily toward the powder.
</p>
<p>
Rex shooed her away with a flick of his hand. “Back off, Mulan. First line is mine.”
</p>
<p>
Four long rails of coke lay drawn across the shiny gray tabletop. He withdrew a dollar bill from his pocket and rolled it into a tight tube. The pock-skinned man sat up straight, tossed his long stringy blond hair behind his head, and prepared for his hit by closing his eyes and breathing a deep, calm exhale. Then, in a smooth motion, he brought the rolled-up dollar bill to one nostril, bowed his head down toward the table, and traced the end of the dollar bill along the bottom-most line while inhaling slowly and steadily. The granules disappeared from the table up into the green tube. 
</p>
<p>
When the line was finished, he slowly pitched his head back with his eyes closed. He gave a slow, satisfied sigh out through his mouth. His hand gripped the table, and despite the calmness of the man’s face, Danny could see the tension in his fingers increasing. Over the course of a minute, the tension slowly climbed upward along his body, through the muscles of his arms and his neck, until a slight tremble reached his head. The man’s breathing turned quick and shallow, almost sexual in its cadence. “Oh… God <em>damn</em>,” he moaned softly.
</p>
<p>
Julie tried to body-check him off of the chair. “My turn!”
</p>
<p>
Rex pushed her away forcefully. She stumbled backwards a few steps. Rex grabbed his gun from his lap and pointed it loosely at her. “Mind your manners, little lady! Guests first. Gentlemen?”
</p>
<p>
Danny stood petrified. Jason shook his head darkly.
</p>
<p>
Rex eyed Jason with a hint of suspicion. “Numbers? You don’t want any?”
</p>
<p>
“No thanks, Rex,” said Jason. The rapid jumps of his eyes told of quick thinking in progress. “Diggitty’s on all sorts of medication, so he can’t have any. And me, I’m too old to get much out of it anymore.”
</p>
<p>
“You sure?” Rex persisted. “It’s great stuff.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t get a high from coke,” said Jason. “I just get a bad headache.”
</p>
<p>
Rex grunted, “Well shit. I hope I never get that old.”
</p>
<p>
Julie stood by with an expression like a cat at a sushi bar.
</p>
<p>
Rex grudgingly muttered permission, and rose from the folding chair. 
</p>
<p>
The man had barely gotten his rear off of the seat before she slid in and grabbed the razorblade and rolled-up dollar bill. Unlike Rex, who had savored the ritual of drawing the lines and taking the first hit, Julie instead simply dove straight into the next line on the table, snorting it up as quickly as her breath would allow. She dropped the dollar bill and held her hands over her mouth and nose. She held her breath for several seconds, looking like she was about to sneeze. Tears built up in her eyes. Her accelerating pulse was visible in her ears.  
</p>
<p>
After almost a minute of sitting motionless, she finally made a sound. A laugh. A euphoric, delighted, childlike laugh.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t feel my face!” she giggled, and traced her fingers sensuously across her mouth and cheeks.
</p>
<p>
Jason watched her indulge. “Listen, Julie. You still have the vial, right?”
</p>
<p>
Julie sat in unresponsive bliss.
</p>
<p>
“Julie, the vial…” he persisted.
</p>
<p>
The girl abruptly turned. “Dude I can hear you just fine, shut the fuck up,” she snapped, her voice rapid and energetic. “Can’t a girl enjoy a freakin’ high? It’s my first hit in like a week, so let me fucking roll with it, okay? Christ. Buzzkill.”
</p>
<p>
“Part of the deal I struck with Rex here,” said Jason, “is that you’d start the incubation.”
</p>
<p>
She guffawed. “Well fuck that! He’s going to shoot me the minute I finish a batch.”
</p>
<p>
Rex rolled his wide-pupilled eyes. “I keep telling you, bitch. If you behave, nobody’s going to shoot you. Fuck, I’ll shoot you if you <em>don’t</em> make a batch sooner or later.”
</p>
<p>
“Alright alright, fine fine fine,” said the girl. “Let me do the rest of these lines and I’ll go pop it in the tank.” Her head again swooped down to the table. Another white rail disappeared.
</p>
<p>
This time, instead of holding her face, her eyes darted back and forth, looking at the various objects on the tabletop. She fidgeted with her hands, and occasionally looked over her shoulder towards where Rex was standing.
</p>
<p>
“Are you okay?” asked Danny.
</p>
<p>
“I’m fine, why?” she said quickly.
</p>
<p>
“You look, I don’t know, agitated,” he observed.
</p>
<p>
“I’m just thinking…” she replied.
</p>
<p>
“About what?” Danny asked.
</p>
<p>
She didn’t answer.
</p>
<p>
From outside, past the large double doors on the opposite side of the factory, there came a sound: the sound of a car pulling up in the alley. It was followed by the sound of car doors opening and closing.
</p>
<p>
The dreadlocked guard said something beyond the wall. His words weren’t clear, but he sounded surprised.
</p>
<p>
Another voice answered him. It had a Russian accent. “…Tonight is complete and total cluster of fucks!…”
</p>
<p>
Danny recognized the voice. It was the voice that he had heard on the stolen cellphone. The voice of Sergey Mukhayev.
</p>
<p>
Rex froze in place. “Oh… shit…” he mumbled. 
</p>
<p>
A third voice rose from behind the large doors, also with a Russian accent, albeit lighter. Danny recognized it as the voice of the man who had threatened to kill him in the Tungsten hallway: Eugene Mukhayev. “That’s the car! That’s their fucking car!”
</p>
<p>
Jason gulped, and backed toward the rear wall to lean on a steel drum.
</p>
<p>
Rex sprang to life. He dashed back toward the table, jostling the glassware on it. The mist inside the clear unlabeled bottle swayed gently. “We’ve got to get rid of the coke! I wasn’t supposed to give you any! I’m not even supposed to have any. Fuck…”
</p>
<p>
Julie, still fidgeting, grabbed clumsily at the square of Saran wrap. While handing it to Rex, she carefully enunciated, “Whoops!”, and fumbled the open packet of powder. Most of the drug spilled onto the floor, forming a small but conspicuous pile near the chair. She swept the remaining cocaine from the table down onto the floor after it.
</p>
<p>
“Oh fuck me!” Rex said, almost panicking. He bent down next to Julie and began sweeping the powder out of sight.
</p>
<p>
“What I was thinking about,” said Julie, speaking rapidly, “was that dopamine is active in more than just the nucleus accumbens. It’s one of the most common neurohormones in the entire human brain. You know where else it’s found?”
</p>
<p>
Jason, his voice dry with terror, said, “Julie, I don’t think we have time for…”
</p>
<p>
“The substantia nigra,” said the girl. “It’s a part of your brain that controls movement. It’s the part that deteriorates in people with Parkinson’s disease. The substantia nigra is connected directly to the reward pathway, and it’s actually <em>more</em> involved in addiction than the pleasure centers. Because, see, the pleasure centers might shape your desires, but the substantia nigra affects what you actually <em>do</em> about those desires.”
</p>
<p>
“Julie, please!” Jason implored. “Just help us think of a way out of here!”
</p>
<p>
Outside, the voices argued. “Nothing? What do you mean, nothing?” shouted Sergey. The African-American man replied, “They scrubbed the car, boss. They even pulled off their VIN tags.”
</p>
<p>
“Now, what’s interesting about the substantia nigra,” Julie continued obliviously, “is that it functions by lateral inhibition. The substantia nigra takes all the possible different things you can do at any given moment, and chooses one based on learned reward expectation. See, your cerebral cortex &mdash; that’s basically the thinking part of your brain &mdash; comes up with dozens of different courses of action, all the time, every second you’re awake. Blink now or blink later? Left foot forward or right foot forward? Voice the word ‘hello’ or voice the word ‘goodbye’? You get the idea…”
</p>
<p>
Rex, his face pale, kept sweeping desperately at the floor. “Fuck fuck fuck! He’s gonna know, he’s gonna know…”
</p>
<p>
Danny watched the Asian girl’s hands as she talked. He noticed a pattern to her movements. She wasn’t fidgeting. She was rehearsing.
</p>
<p>
“…But of all those actions you’re thinking of taking all the time,” Julie resumed, “only one ever wins out. And it’s the substantia nigra that makes the selection, of all the hypothetical bodily movements you can possibly take, which one will reach its activation threshold and ultimately send an impulse to the corresponding muscles. And the substantia nigra, like the mesolimbic pathway, runs on dopamine.”
</p>
<p>
“Julie!” Jason barked. “Either help or shut up!”
</p>
<p>
From the alley, the voice of Sergey said commandingly, “You fucking stay here! Guard door like you were supposed to in a first place! Eugene and I go take care of this ourselves. We have score to settle with these assholes.” 
</p>
<p>
Footsteps ascended the stairs outside.
</p>
<p>
Danny, his head spinning from fear, gasped, “Julie, what’s your point?”
</p>
<p>
Suddenly she stopped moving and locked eyes with Danny. “My point,” she said slowly, “is that dopamine is the substance that converts thought into action.”
</p>
<p>
She turned to look down at Rex on the floor hiding the mess of cocaine. She gave him an innocent smile. “And do you know what I’m thinking right now?” she asked him sweetly.
</p>
<p>
“What?” the pock-skinned, long-haired blond man growled, looking up from his crouched position next to her chair.
</p>
<p>
And she swiftly reached across the table, grabbed the clear unlabeled bottle, pulled out the stopper, and poured half a liter of eleven molar hydrochloric acid down onto his face. 
</p>
